  Founded in 2014 by author and entrepreneur Paul Hawken  --  in collaboration with over 200 researchers  --  Project Drawdown is one of the most influential research-backed databases of climate solutions on the planet. Produced by hundreds of outstanding writers and researchers across the continents, this is indeed a visionary and comprehensive resource for understanding both the challenges and solutions of this climate change era, the Anthropocene. Truly an exciting and hopeful read.

  "Our mission is to help the world stop climate change  -  as quickly, safely, and equitably as possible. To do this, we pursue three key strategies:

       *  Advance Effective, Science-based Climate Solutions and Strategies. We use science to find effective 'whole system' solutions and strategies for stopping climate change.

       *  Foster Bold, New Climate Leadership. We inform, inspire, and empower business leaders, investors, and philanthropists to take bold, new positions, act more strategically, and rapidly bring climate solutions to scale.

       *  Promote New Narratives and New Voices. We work to shift the conversation about climate change from 'doom and gloom' to 'possibility and opportunity.' And we elevate new, underrepresented climate heroes through storytelling and 'passing the mic.'"
