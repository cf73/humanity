  Transparency
  Impact 
  Accountability
  1) Transparency

  Transparency is the most crucial factor in the selection of the best NGOs. It includes a dedication to transparency in an NGO’s operations. This includes the requirement for groups to declare their funding sources, spending plans, and budgets. Programmatic transparency is crucial as NGOs provide specifics about their initiatives, goals, and results. It provides one with a clear understanding of how an NGO uses its resources and what is their progress. It also promotes trust among all parties that are involved, including donors, beneficiaries, and the public. 

  2) Impact

  The impact of an NGO plays a vital role in its credibility. NGOs are assessed based on the noticeable and long-lasting changes they bring about in the communities and regions they aid. Investigators carefully analyze the results of an NGO project as proof of transformative results. Impact measurement goes beyond numbers; it examines the improvement of beneficiaries’ socioeconomic status, education, and quality of life. A leading NGO must have a distinct, measurable, and positive influence on the issues it addresses.


  3) Accountability

  Accountability goes hand in hand with transparency and impact. NGOs must be held accountable for their actions, choices, and resource allocation. Accountability entails upholding moral principles and legal requirements while making sure that an organization’s objectives line up with its mission and values. Additionally, it includes the effective administration of resources, in which money is spent wisely to optimize its effects. In addition to promoting donor confidence, a commitment to accountability helps NGOs to continuously enhance and adapt their methods for greater effectiveness.

  These three are the main factors that influence the eligibility and credibility of an NGO.
