  "Our Work Around the World

  "Every child deserves a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. Yet, an estimated 5.4 million children under age 5 still die each year from preventable causes; 250 million children around the world canâ€™t read, despite years of schooling; and far too many are experiencing physical and emotional abuse, sexual exploitation, deprivation and neglect. 

  "That's why  --   as global leaders in child health, education and protection  --  we're working in more than 100 countries to change the lives of over 100 million children every year."
