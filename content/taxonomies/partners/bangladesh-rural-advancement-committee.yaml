  BRAC International operates in 10 countries across Africa and Asia. We envision a world free from all forms of exploitation and discrimination, where everyone has the opportunity to realise their potential.
  BRAC International Holdings B.V. was set up in 2010 as a private limited liability company and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stichting BRAC International.
  BRAC International is a leading nonprofit organisation with a mission to empower people and communities in situations of poverty, illiteracy, disease, and social injustice. Our approach is grounded in the conviction that people living in vulnerable situations can be agents of change if they are empowered with the tools, skills, and hope they need to change their lives. We design proven, scalable solutions that equip people with the support and confidence they need to achieve their potential. BRAC’s institutional expertise on successfully implemented programmes is applied across 10 countries, touching the lives of over 130 million people, where our models are adapted according to the country’s context.

  BRAC International Holdings B.V. (BIHBV) is a socially responsible for-profit organisation engaging people in sustainable economic and income-generating activities. The core focus of BIHBV is to provide microfinance services to people living in poverty to build financial resilience, contribute to women’s economic empowerment and improve the quality of life in the communities it serves. BRAC first expanded its microfinance operations internationally in 2002 and now operates in six countries across Asia and Africa, serving more than 650,000 clients, 96% of whom are women.
