        text: "In the midst of this erratic era of self-centered leadership, may it be revitalizing to listen to a head of state who brokered lasting peace with long-term terrorists (52-year civil war with\_FARC); shared a 2,000 mile border with a disastrous dictator; was profoundly involved with the war on drugs; and yet made substantial social, economic and environmental progress, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016.\_"
