        text: 'We accept this polarity as human nature then move on in our ‘glassy essence’. All the while our righteousness lords over other life; yet we beseech gods for mercy.

So many are victims of injustice, of the vagaries of despotism or of ill luck, with no legal system to which they can bring their wisps of\_hope."
