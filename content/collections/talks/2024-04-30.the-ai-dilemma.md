        text: "The AI dilemma arises from the rapid advances in artificial intelligence. While these advances have the potential to benefit humanity, there is also a risk that creating an intelligence smarter than humans, which is not aligned with our goals, could lead to existential risks. Researchers warn that if we don't coordinate and align AI development with human values, it could result in tragedy. Integrating different logics of power  --  including engineering, social justice, corporate, and government logic  --  is crucial for ensuring that AI benefits humanity."
