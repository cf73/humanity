        text: '"If you think democracy is some kind of inevitable, default setting for the world, then you aren''t going to have it for very long," says historian and author Timothy Snyder. From World War I to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Snyder dives into the structures that uplift and tear down political systems, offering a historical perspective on the current state of democracy around the world as well as the patterns of thought that lead to tyranny. He discusses a new approach to democracy that could help create and protect a future of freedom.'
