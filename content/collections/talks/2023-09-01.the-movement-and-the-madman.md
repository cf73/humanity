        text: "This full-length film explores Nixon and Kissinger's engagement with the antiwar movement of the late 1960's. Especially during this time of war and a crucial presidential election, it's important to share the core message of this film: it's about the power of protest and the necessity to stay engaged.\_"

  HOW TO SEE THE FILM NOW
   
  "With our public television premier on March 28, 2023, we reached a large national, primetime audience  --  over half a million viewers. The audience continues to grow as local PBS stations rebroadcast the film.
   
  "PBS Passport members can view the film free on the American Experience website. It is also free to view on Kanopy through local public libraries and colleges that offer that streaming service.
   
  "You also can watch it on Amazon Prime for a small fee. In addition, Chapter One  --  the opening 12 minutes of our film  --  is on The American Experience YouTube page (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfhHcq-IUQo&t=4s) where it has nearly 100,000 views."
