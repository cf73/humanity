        text: 'From World War I to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Snyder dives into the structures that uplift and tear down political systems, offering a historical perspective on the current state of democracy around the world as well as the patterns of thought that lead to tyranny. He discusses a new approach to democracy that could help create and protect a future of freedom.'
