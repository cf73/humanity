        text: 'From World War I to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Snyder also dives into the structures that uplift and tear down political systems, offering historical perspective on the current state of democracy throughout the world as well as discussing patterns of thought that lead to tyranny. Not least, he introduces a new approach to democracy that could help create and protect a future of freedom.'
