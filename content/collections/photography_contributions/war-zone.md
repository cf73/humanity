        text: 'Traveling to dangerous and remote places to document crucial moments  --   Afghanistan under the Taliban immediately before and after the 9/11 attacks; Iraq following the US-led invasion and the dismantlement of Saddam Hussein’s government; western Sudan in the aftermath of the genocide in Darfur  --  Linsey creates sensitive visual testimony not only of war and injustice but also of humanity, dignity, and resilience.'
