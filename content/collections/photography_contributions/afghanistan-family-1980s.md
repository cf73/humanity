        text: "Luke Powell, an American photographer from North Carolina, spent six years photographing in the Fertile Crescent  --  birthplace of agriculture and domestication  --  from the late 1970's to the early 1980's, creating his famous Afghan Folio. Luke was a master of the golden mean and, not least, he was one of the few image-makers who still made his own dye-transfer prints, which he exhibited widely across the planet. "
