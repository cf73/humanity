        text: "I saw this guy riding along side saddle in Antigua and stopped to talk. He thought that a clean-cut white guy might want to buy drugs. I said no, I wanted to photograph him and his donkey. He was delighted. So I asked him to ride out a little into the field next to the road and then turn and charge at me with the machete. That's how I got such a natural smile!"
