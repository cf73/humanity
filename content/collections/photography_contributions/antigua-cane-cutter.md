        text: 'I saw this guy on his way home from cutting cane in the Parish of St. Paul in Antigua and immediately thought "photograph!" He had imagined I was a tourist who might want to buy drugs, so he was surprised and delighted by my request merely for a photo. I suggested he ride out into the field next to the road, then turn and charge towards me, machete in full regard. He happily agreed, each of us enjoying the play.'
