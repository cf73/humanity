        text: 'I saw this guy on his way home from cutting cane in the Parish of St. Paul in Antigua and immediately thought "photograph!" He had imagined I was a tourist wanting to buy drugs, so he was surprised and delighted by my request merely for a photo. I suggested he ride out into the field next to the road, turn and charge towards me, machete in full regard. He happily agreed, each of us enjoying our interplay across cultures.'
