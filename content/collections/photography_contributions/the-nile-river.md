        text: "From headwaters in Burundi, the graceful White Nile flows slowly northward through Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South Sudan, combining in Sudan at Khartoum with it's sister, the Blue Nile  --  arriving out of Ethiopia with 80% of the Nile's volume  --  and then onward through the Egyptian desert as the well fabled Nile River, longest on Earth."
