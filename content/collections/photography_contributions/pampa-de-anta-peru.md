        text: "Englebert crossed Borneo's rainforest from end to end by houseboat, canoe, and on foot, with eight porters to carry his money (trade goods). Victor has tramped through the Amazon many times, once in search of mysterious pyramids and once spending a month among the Yanomami Indians. Throughout his adventures, Englebert faced many dangers, including falling into the hands of Eritrean guerillas in Ethiopia who mistook him for an Israeli spy and put a revolver to his head. However, they spared him when they discovered two admissions into Algeria in his passport, as Israelis were not allowed into the Arab country."

        text: ' Victor took this image of a little girl sitting all alone by the side of the road in the pampa de Anta, near Cuzco, Peru. When the countryside bus he was traveling on slowed to a quick stop, no one else was waiting there, no one got off the bus, and the little girl and her little dog, each holding the same expression, did not move. Victor told me he had time for only one quick image and had to run a few yards when the bus began rolling again.    '

        text: 'One rainy day in New York City  --  while Victor was making the rounds of publishers in hopes of creating a coffee table book  --  he stopped at a Times Square cafe for a sandwich. As he was paying the bill at the counter by the front door, he placed his small suitcase on the floor next his right leg. It contained every single one of his original negatives and slides from over twenty years of work.'

        text: 'Victor spent the next five hours in utter despair and dismay, uncertain of what would become of his life. The local police suggested he rifle through all the garbage cans he could find. Without any luck by nightfall, Victor got on the subway to Queens, filthy and defeated, headed for the home of friends of friends from his native Belgium who had offered him a place to stay.'

Before Victor could get a word in, his hosts said,"Oh, you must know. Your package arrived a few hours ago, by taxi." Victor was not expecting a package and had no idea what she was referring to.'
