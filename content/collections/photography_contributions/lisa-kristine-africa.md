        text: '"The Omo Valley is situated in the most remote and inaccessible part of Ethiopia. Only in 1992 did many of its natives became aware that there was even a country called Ethiopia and that they were part of it. In this ancient, unaffected other world, millennium old lifestyles still thrive. Hunters and gatherers cloaked in animal skins roam undisturbed by modernity or outside influence.'

        text: '"The Hamar women are renowned for their beauty; the strength and elegance in each gesture is unforgettable. Living so closely with the earth, it seems only fitting that ocher clay is used as a cosmetic for both skin and hair. The spirit of these individuals is intense and grounded. To witness pride with true purity still intact is a sight which is not only a wonder but also an inspiration."'
