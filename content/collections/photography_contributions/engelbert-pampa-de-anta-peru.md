        text: "He crossed Borneo's rainforest from end to end by houseboat, canoe, and on foot, with eight porters to carry his money (trade goods). Victor has tramped through the Amazon many times, once in search of mysterious pyramids and once spending a month among the Yanomami Indians. Throughout his adventures, Englebert faced many dangers, including falling into the hands of Eritrean guerillas in Ethiopia who mistook him for an Israeli spy and put a revolver to his head. However, they spared him when they discovered two admissions into Algeria in his passport, as Israelis were not allowed into the Arab country."

        text: ' Victor took this image of a little girl sitting all alone by the side of the road in the pampa de Anta, near Cuzco, Peru. When the countryside bus he was traveling on slowed to a quick stop, no one else was waiting there, no one got off the bus, and the little girl and her little dog, each holding the same expression, did not move. Victor told me he had time for only one quick image and had to run a few yards when the bus began rolling again.    '

Before Victor could get a word in, the wife of the couple said encouragingly,"Oh, you must know that your package arrived a few hours ago, by taxi." Victor was not expecting a package.
