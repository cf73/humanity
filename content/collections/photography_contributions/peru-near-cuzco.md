        text: "Werner Bishchof's son, then living in his native Switzerland, told THI that he was proud and delighted that we had chosen his dad's shot of the Peruvian boy for the first cover of humanity  --  after a search that included two days of going through thousands of files at Magnum Photos in New York City. For us, it was the perfect combination for our watch words:  youth, travel, optimism, independence...and an innately positive feeling about the journey and the moment. A bonus was that it had music in it as well. We printed it without overlay."
