        text: '"The ancient dhows are a common and breathtaking sight. They glide by, sails full of humid, strong wind, carrying people to their destinations. They are the revered vessels of fisherman and the vehicle for the carefree sea-goer. But mostly, in their old and earthy character, the dhow contains a mystical quality which sets them apart from other sail boats.'
