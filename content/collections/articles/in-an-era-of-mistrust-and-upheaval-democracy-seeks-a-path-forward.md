        text: ' this year contemplated the meaning of “A Moment of Truth.” It was an intriguing theme. In one sense this is clearly not such a moment, for misrepresentations, deepfakes and outright lies abound. The term “fake news” has entered the global lexicon.'

        text: 'But of course “moment of truth” is a metaphor for a turning point, or a time of critical decisions, roughly what the ancient Greeks called kairos and is being referred to now as an “inflection point.” Much of humanity, it seems, feels the world is building toward some overarching crisis, induced by war, or the rapid advance of A.I., or climate change, or the isolating impact of technology, or the unbearable acceleration of life, or some combination of them all.'

        text: 'The Athens Democracy Forum, a gathering of global leaders last week in association with The New York Times, was inhabited by a particular sense of unease. Inevitably there was talk of the stubborn war in Ukraine and the spreading war in the Middle East. Their terrible toll cast a pall. As after 9/11 two decades ago, the world has changed since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack and Israel’s devastating retaliation against Palestinians in Gaza.'

        text: 'Across the world, the gathering acknowledged, mistrust advances in the cacophony of social media. Compromise, without which democracy struggles, has been one victim of this clamor. We live increasingly in an all-or-nothing culture. The uncertainty surrounding a close-run American election, and the fracture in many Western societies between the connected living in the “somewhere” of the knowledge economy and the forgotten living “nowhere” in industrial wastelands and rural areas, undermine the West. It finds itself in a moment of relative weakness as other powers, including Russia and China with their authoritarian systems, push anti-American agendas.'

        text: 'Anger and anxiety feed extremist parties and questioning of democratic systems. “Democracy is fragile,” Corinne Momal-Vanian, the executive director of the Kofi Annan Foundation, told the forum. “It has many enemies.” But, she insisted, there is no substitute for “representative, inclusive and accountable” governance if people are to be free and empowered. As she noted, democracy “is also resilient.”'

Of course, this was not in real life but in an iCivics online game. Still, he was passionate about his political efforts, as were many of the young democracy advocates from across the world who attended the forum.'

He was introduced by Ms. Momal-Vanian as the winner of the Kofi Annan NextGen Democracy Prize, which recognizes exceptional leadership among people 18 to 30 in the advancement of democracy.'
