        text: 'Amidst the daily mass suffering and horrific battles in the Middle East, much of the focus remains squarely on Israel’s military operation in Gaza and the horrifying humanitarian fallout. But the Middle East Peace Dialogue I hosted at Yale last week provided a powerful reminder that despite daily tragedies, peaceful coexistence between Jews and Muslims and between Israel, the Palestinians, and Arab neighbors is not just an “impossible dream.”'

In the fall of 1621, 90 members of the indigenous Wampanoag tribe joined 52 English pilgrims in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to mark a successful harvest at the time of the ancient Hebrew holiday of Succoth.'

        text: 'Headline guests also included Abraham Accords architect Jared Kushner, and longtime Middle East advisor to several U.S. presidents Ambassador Dennis Ross, among many others. In 2019, Kushner unveiled a $50 billion economic plan, one whose implementation would be predicated on a future political peace agreement. His plan gave the opposing parties a chance to visualize what the quality of life could look like when tensions subside. Drawing on the remarkable economic development successes in other countries that have been torn by past political violence, such as South Korea, the proposal detailed highly specific uses of grants, low-interest loans, and private investment intended to double the size of the Palestinian economy, create one million new jobs, reduce Palestinian unemployment from 30% to single digits, and reduce Palestinian poverty by 50%.'

        text: 'Roughly 190 specific projects in the Bahrain Plan would aim to increase export revenue from 17% to 40% of Palestinian GDP, ensure reliable electricity, double the drinkable water supply, connect more schools to high-speed data services, increase women’s participation in the workforce, and generate a 500% increase in foreign direct investment. The plan would have boosted investment in key industries such as tourism, agriculture, digital services, housing, and manufacturing; it would also have also provided for infrastructure enhancements such as a $5 billion high-speed highway connecting Gaza to the West Bank. Then, as now, Palestinian officials boycotted the discussions we facilitated–but regional and international investors such as the UAE’s Emaar Properties founder Mohamed Alabbar and Blackstone Chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman endorsed the plan that would have improved the lives of people across the region.'

There is nothing wrong with learning old languages, but it is also nice when old universities are at the forefront of current issues. Sadly, however, in recent weeks, old universities have often been at the forefront for the wrong reasons amidst campus unrest with alarming rises in both antisemitic and Islamophobic violence.'

        text: 'With hostile fractious exchanges at fellow Ivy League schools such as Penn, Harvard, and Cornell, as well as more positive examples such as those at Dartmouth, we were proud that on this spectrum, Yale modeled respectful, interfaith, cross-cultural, and interdisciplinary exchanges, showing that we can all still talk to each other with respect and find areas of common ground even if we do not agree on everything, on college campuses and beyond. Partisan leanings were virtually imperceptible; in fact, even before any discussions commenced, the audience–including leading bipartisan Mideast voices–gave a rousing standing ovation to Jared Kushner in recognition of his role in the Abraham Accords, which paved the way for Arab and Israeli normalization of relations and for public forums such as this one, which just five years ago would have been impossible.'

We were further joined by 80 senior Yale faculty members and bipartisan, interfaith Mideast experts, ranging from former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo to Iranian-American journalist to Ethan Allen CEO and Muslim-Jewish Council Co-Chair Farooq Kathwari, to former deputy national security advisor Olivia Troye, and many others.'

Dialogue. That is my prayer today.” Imam Abdul Rauf movingly appealed, “We Muslims believe that God has 99 descriptive names, one of which is peace as Salaam, so may God’s attribute of peace descend upon us here in this gathering, on all of us participating in this discourse today, and move us to help implement peace.”'

Furthermore, while there were cordial disagreements, there were also issues where our guests, Arab and Israeli, Muslim and Jewish alike, were largely if not completely in agreement, which may provide a reassuring blueprint to an eventual “day-after scenario” once the current violence ends.'

A Yale College senior who spent two summers in high school at a camp called Seeds of Peace and has kept in touch with a number of Israeli and Palestinian friends said they struggled with how to engage with the topic on campus when the conversation is so charged, but that our event gave them hope that there’s a viable model for solutions-oriented conversations.'

It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”'
