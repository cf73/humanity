To one side, a cocoi heron picked its way across lilypads in search of frogs, its long-feathered plumes rising and falling in the soft breeze. On the other, a family of capybara stood partly submerged in the mud, while a languid yacaré caiman warmed itself nearby, mouth agape. Here in Iberá, every part of the aquatic landscape is seemingly filled with life.'

The couple began purchasing large tracts of land from cattle ranchers, initially with the aim of protecting them. But when they saw that many longstanding Iberá residents – such as the jaguar, giant otter, tapir and giant anteater – had completely disappeared, and other species, such as the pampas deer and ocelot, were on the brink of the same fate, they realised they had to do more.'

We soon came to understand that we weren't simply in the business of creating national parks, but that in places like Iberá, there was a need and obligation to restore entire ecosystems. We realised we had to rewild, and that was a whole new ballgame.\""
