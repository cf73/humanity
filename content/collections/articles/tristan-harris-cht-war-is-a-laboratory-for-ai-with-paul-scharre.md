        text: "The official procedure was clear, at the first indication of a US nuclear strike, the USSR would launch a counterstrike on US cities. The computers were unequivocal, the missiles were coming, but Petrov waited. He didn't inform his superiors. He knew tensions were high between the two countries, but it just didn't make sense to him that the US would strike in that particular way."

The missiles didn't arrive, and when the incident was investigated, the Soviets discovered that a rare alignment of sunlight on high-altitude clouds and the satellites had triggered a false alarm. Petrov's hesitance saved the world from nuclear war, but would an AI-based system have made the same call?"

The development of fully autonomous weapons is showing little signs of slowing down. So what does that mean for the future of warfare? What safeguards can we put up around these systems?'

Today we're going to sit down with Paul Scharre to try to answer some of these questions. Paul is the author of two books on autonomous weapons. He's a former army ranger, and he helped the Department of Defense write a lot of its policy on the use of AI in weaponry. So this is a critical conversation and we're pleased to have an expert like Paul help us get a sense for how AI will change the way wars are fought. Thank you, Paul, for coming on the show."

        text: "I was in Ukraine a few weeks ago and met with government officials and people from the Ukrainian defense industry, anywhere from large state-owned defense companies, all the way to just a whole host of small startups. And the level of innovation in the technology and tactics in Ukraine is really unprecedented. Where the big development right now in Ukraine is autonomous terminal guidance. So that's where and a lot of these drones are remotely controlled, they're piloted by a person, but because there's a lot of drones, there's also a lot of jamming that's going on, where people are jamming the communications link because if the drone is remotely piloted, well, once you jam that communications link, then the drone's pretty useless. And so people are adding in more autonomy, particularly for the last mile once a person has chosen a target to complete that attack. But that is a stepping stone towards, in the future, more autonomous weapons."

What's special about right now? Is it about the conflict or is it about where we are in the technological development?"

        text: "Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. I think it's both. So 10 years ago we just couldn't see the types of things that we're seeing in Ukraine now, but also war is a real accelerant of innovation. We're now over two years into this war, it's settled down into a long grinding war of attrition between Russia and Ukraine. And Ukraine doesn't have the people or the industrial production to go toe-to-toe with Russia and trade sort of person-for-person in this kind of war. So they've got to find ways to be clever, be innovative, and that's driving it as well. And I think it's just worth remembering that war is thankfully rare. And so most of the time in peacetime, militaries are coming up with things that they think will be valuable, but they don't get immediate feedback on what is going to work or is not going to work. They don't find out oftentimes until they fight a war. And so now when you have a longer war like we're seeing in Ukraine, on both sides, you can get really rapid feedback loops that can accelerate innovation very quickly."

What's the difference between remotely operated, semi-autonomous, fully autonomous, human in the loop, human on the loop? Give us a little bit of a tour of categories so we know what we're dealing with here."

Sometimes that remote operation is a little more removed, where for some of the more advanced drones, like a Global Hawk for example, it's a very large, very expensive US military drone, flies up at 60,000 feet, very high altitude. Some of those more advanced drones are flown with a keyboard and a mouse, but they're still directed by humans where to go and what to do. We're starting to move towards more autonomy and different functions for drones, whether it's navigation or automated takeoff and landing, for example."

Now for cars, there's a clear vision on the horizon of a point in time in the future, a fully autonomous car that won't even have a steering wheel. Now for militaries, at least for weapons, that vision of the future is one of an autonomous weapon that would still be built by humans and launched by humans to go out into the battle space to perform some task. But then, once launched, would be on its own and using its programming or some onboard AI, you know, some machine learning algorithm that its been trained on, would identify targets all on its own and then attack them and complete that attack and carry out the attack all by itself."

        text: "We're not quite there yet. There have been a couple, one-off examples historically, but certainly we don't see autonomous weapons in widespread use, but there's a lot of advancements that are taking us in that direction, and that seems to be the arc of the technology right now. And there are, some of the terms you used, semi-autonomous for example, would be a weapon that has many of those functions, but a human is still choosing the target. And sometimes people use the term supervised autonomous or a human on the loop to mean a circumstance where the weapon could complete that engagement on its own, but a human could supervise it and could intervene if things go wrong. Just like if you had somebody maybe sitting in the driver's seat of a Tesla on autopilot and they're, you know, supposed to be, at least in theory, hands on the wheel being attentive, they could jump in if something goes wrong. Those are all different possibilities for autonomy as well in weapon systems."

        text: "Adding to that, there seem to be two different kinds of narratives around weapon autonomy. One narrative is this precision narrative that says if these things are guided by a kind of a calculus, then you don't have some of the things that make war awful: people who decompensate emotionally and start targeting the wrong people, you know, long nights of low sleep and sleep induced poor performance that result in people dying. On the other hand, the narrative on the other side is that this kind of cold, calculating, human not being in the loop might lead to the normalization of casualties and the normalization of violence"

        text: "Well, I think you captured very well the two arguments that are out there sort of in favor of autonomous weapons or opposed to them. Of course there's been a movement of a number of different humanitarian groups in several countries opposed to autonomous weapons and calling for a preemptive ban on them before we see them sort of built and used in a widespread fashion. But others have said that they could be more precise and more humane over time. I think there's actually validity to both of those, and it's possible to envision a future where both of those things become true, that there could be some conflicts when you have militaries that care a lot about the rule of law and avoiding civilian casualties, where in some settings autonomous weapons might be more beneficial. They might be more, not just militarily effective, but also more effective in avoiding civilian casualties."

        text: "There might be other settings where they become a slippery slope towards people broadening the aperture of who's targeted leading to civilian casualties, or they could lead to accidents, to situations where maybe it's not an intentional use of an autonomous weapon in a bad way. It's not a war crime, but the weapon makes a mistake and certainly, depending on the weapon and how it's used, there could be a lot of civilian casualties. So I think that actually we could end up in a future where both of those visions become true. And then the question is how do we approach this technology in a way that's thoughtful in terms of how we use it and how we govern it and regulate it to avoid some of the worst harms?"

The incentives for military seem like they're multifactorial from easier logistics to faster counter-response. Can you talk for a second about why it is that militaries are rushing headlong into this technology?"

        text: "Sure. So maybe it's worth unpacking here the difference between, for example, autonomous weapons, so a weapon system that itself would go out and attack targets on its own, versus the use of autonomy or automation or AI more broadly across the military space. And we're seeing that militaries around the world are very interested in AI and automation for a whole wide variety of tasks, for maintenance and logistics and personnel management, for the same reasons that a lot of industries are, because it could improve efficiencies and save money and reduce personnel requirements and make things more effective. And, you know, most of what militaries do is not actually the fighting. Militaries talk about tooth to tail and sort of the tooth being the fighting component of the military"

And some of those things like personnel applications raise the same kinds of concerns about bias and hiring and promotion that you might get in other fields as well. The value for militaries in the autonomous weapon space is really like, there's a lot of value for adding AI. Could you make more precise decisions if you have image classifiers that help identify objects? Sure, there's value in that. I guess one question is like, what's the value with taking away the human? Because we know that despite all of the amazing things that AI could do, there's still lots of ways in which humans add a lot of value, particularly in terms of understanding context and in novel situations where the AI system may not perform as well."

And the other one is if the communications link is lost with some controller with a drone as we started talking about. But I do think there's a lot of value in humans and militaries are going to find that they're going to want to keep humans in the loop whenever they can, whenever that's feasible for them."

I was on a sniper team and we were up on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and we'd infiltrated at night and we were setting up a hide site where we were going to watch for insurgents coming across the border. This turns out to be, as an aside, an insane task because the Afghanistan-Pakistan border is massive and unmarked and mountainous, so it's very much like, sort of, a drop in an ocean. But in any case, that was the mission. So we hiked at this mountain at night, and when the sun came up, we were very exposed and there was not a lot of vegetation in the area. There was about eight of us piled behind a couple rocks. So very quickly this farmer came out into his fields and he spotted us. So we knew people were coming to get us, so we hunkered down."

Well, nobody suggested the idea of shooting this little girl. Like, that wasn't a topic that was raised, and that certainly would not have been consistent with my values that I was raised with or what we were taught in the army. But what's interesting is under the law of war, that would've been legal. The law of war doesn't set an age for combatants. So by scouting for the enemy, she was participating in hostilities the same way as if she'd been an eighteen-year-old male doing that same task. So if you programmed a robot to perfectly comply with the law of war, it would've shot this little girl."

You know, in this instance, the fate of the war did not turn on that moment, but it certainly meant a lot to that little girl and to us to make sure that you were doing the right thing. And machines may not always know what that is."

And, you know, for people outside the military, forget about autonomy for a second, for people outside the military, even talking about concepts like acceptable levels of collateral damage or acceptable levels of people killed who you don't want to kill.

And just as one quick aside, when I was in college, the trolley problem was this philosophy experiment around, you know, trying to decide the boundaries of different meta-ethical theories, it was useless. And now fast-forward 20 years later, we're having to program this into our autonomous vehicles to decide who to kill in a case where an accident is unavoidable. And so this isn't just about war, it's about how much do we cede"

I mean, one of the things you write about Paul, is, you know, our previous laws of war don't account for drones and new kinds of automated submarines. And basically the laws and the categories that we've been guided by thus far are constantly getting outdated and undermined by technology inventing millions of new categories underneath that. And so what that forces us to do is look at the spirit of those laws and then reinterpret them. But kind of the meta challenge that we talk about in our work at Center for Humane Technology is that our 18th century institutions aren't able to articulate the new distinctions as fast as the technology requires out of them. To put it in Nick Bostrom's terms, AI is like philosophy on a deadline, we have these urgent philosophical questions and now we have a deadline to actually answer them because we are instrumenting our society with more AI."

Certainly there's a set of class of problems that is sort of, okay, we're having to task a machine to perform something that humans used to do. And now the rules that we're implicit for humans, we have to write down, as you explained for vehicles for example, in some cases, maybe those rules weren't written down just because we trusted human judgment to figure it out. In some cases, maybe the case of drivers, maybe human reflexes aren't even good enough to be making really deliberate conscious decisions in the middle of the crash, but now we're going to have to write down those rules. So that's one set of challenges and that exists certainly in the military space as well."

And I think some of the things that you were saying about humans are much better at understanding context for decisions. And so one of the ways that I think about this, at least in the military space is, if there's a type of task where there is a clear metric for better performance, and either we have good data on what good performance look like or we can generate that data, that's probably the kind of task where we can train a machine to do it, whether it's landing an aircraft on an aircraft carrier or some other kind of skill, aiming a rifle properly is a great example of this.

But there's a lot of things where there isn't a clear right answer. And it depends a lot on context, what we want to think of as judgment. So for example, you know, if you have an image in, you know, an infrared camera or a video at night of a person, and we don't know what the person's holding, are they holding a rifle in their hands or a rake in their hands, there's a right or wrong answer to that. We could probably train image classifiers do a better job than humans if we have enough data, but to then go to the next question which is, is that person an enemy combatant?"

It could be that they're holding an innocuous object like a shovel, but they're digging a hole for a roadside bomb and they are participating in hostilities, and that's really hard for machines right now. And so those are the kinds of things that I think we're going to need human judgment for the foreseeable future, and those are the things that we want to hold onto.

On the other hand, you know, you have these sort of dystopian version of this where you have poorly trained eighteen-year-olds who are under slept, who have been emotionally decompensated in the field, making decisions that perhaps a machine should have overseen.

The current policy that's in place and it was updated last year, is fairly flexible that it lays out some categories of things that the military has done in the past. Good familiarity with, that are fine to do and for anything that's sort of new, it creates a process for bringing together people from different parts of the military community: lawyers, policy professionals, military leaders, engineers to think through some of these challenges that we're discussing when they have a practical weapon system and people are saying, well, can we build this?

So there's no question that we're going to see lots of countries, not just advanced militaries and non-state groups using this technology. I think what worries me is that not everyone is going to be thoughtful about avoiding civilian casualties, about complying with the law of war. There have just been some recent reports about Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine. That's not like up for debate whether chemical weapons are legal in war, there's a global ban on chemical weapons and all.

It's a competitive environment and ultimately militaries want to fuel forces that are going to win on a battlefield, and if they lose a war, the consequences can be catastrophic for that nation. You know, certainly, we see in Ukraine for example, that that country is fighting for its existence against Russia. And so one of the concerns is that you begin to see this compression of decision cycles, of the targeting cycle where people are identifying targets and making a decision, what sometimes is called the OODA loop in warfare, the observe, orient, decide, act loop, where people are sort of understanding the battle space and then making a decision and then acting on it.

Now we've seen this in stock trading. This is not a theoretical concept. We've seen this whole domain of high-frequency trading emerge where algorithms are making trades in milliseconds, at superhuman speeds that humans could never try to be in the loop for those kinds of trades."

I think what's concerning to me is the way that financial regulators have dealt with this problem is they've installed circuit breakers to take stocks offline if the price moves too quickly, but that doesn't exist in warfare.

John Boyd from the Air Force came up with this concept and basically you're only as good as and you are accurate in being able to update your OODA loop. And as militaries build an autonomy with the incentive of tightening that decision-making chain, tightening their logistics chain, tightening their targeting chain, tightening their execution chain, they have that incentive. And the more that they do that, the more their competitors do that. And even if they believe or are paranoid that their competitors might do that, that's why even though we say we don't want these weapons to be built, we can't guarantee the other guys not going to build them. And so we keep accelerating and building them ourselves."

And we, what worries, I think so many people about drones and autonomous weapons is the idea that it's kind of unclear what would happen."

And I'm just trying to think about what are the concepts that we need to prevent what we all don't want to happen, which is this kind of runaway, omni lose-lose scenario that's more ambiguous with smaller scale weaponry that's autonomous versus the large scale nuclear situation."

I think the first place that people go to is like, well, we shouldn't use it for nuclear weapons. That seems like an easy one. We shouldn't do that. Now the crazy thing is we actually have a fair amount of automation in nuclear command and control. Already in many cases we've had for decades, both throughout the Cold War and the US and the Soviet Union to help speed up elements of processing. So for example, if the president were to make a decision to use nuclear weapons, there's elements of automation and sort of carrying those orders out to people to make sure that they're executed correctly. Now, a lot of that's human driven, but there are going to be places where militaries do start to use AI that touch on things like intelligence collection or early warning or parts of automation in executing decisions, for example."

Now, the United States Government Defense Department has said, they have an explicit policy that humans will always be in the loop for any decisions pertaining to the decision to use nuclear weapons or executing the decision to use nuclear weapons by the president.

It had a certain logic to it. And the logic was that one of the challenges in nuclear stability is that if you get warning that someone is launching missiles at you, you can have this use or lose dilemma of having a very short time, you know, maybe 10, 15 minutes to make a decision, to launch your missiles before your missiles get wiped out or your command gets wiped out, and they wanted to reduce that pressure from them."

Militaries are able to comply with these rules in practice, political leaders have imperfect control over their military forces. And so that's also important. So for example, in the early days of World War II, Britain and Germany both refrained from bombing populated areas when they conducted their aerial bombing campaigns, and in fact Hitler put out in a rule that the Luftwaffe was not to bomb populated areas in Britain, only to bomb industrial targets for the war, not because Hitler was a good person, because he was afraid of the British Air Force and he was worried about retaliation."

So militaries have to also comply with these rules that they're trying to do and the sort of cost-benefit calculus for militaries of what are they giving up needs to be in their favor. That's part of the reason why we've been so successful with some exceptions, as I mentioned earlier, but generally successful with countries walking away from chemical and biological weapons today in part because they're not that useful on the battlefield. And we've seen this in practice as militaries have used them, particularly against troops that have chemical gear. They somewhat slow down their movements, but they're certainly not decisive in the way that nuclear weapons are, for example."

But there's a lot of space in the interim. So for example, you could see a narrower ban on anti-personnel autonomous weapons.

There's no way to keep a human in the loop in that kind of world, we're attacking radar systems with automated fire responses. Well, humans are not that fast. Like outrunning a machine gun has not been an effective tactic since World War I. And so at the speed at which humans move, you could keep a human in the loop. And for militaries, for high-end warfare, a lot of that is against machines. You're targeting artillery and radar and ships and submarines and aircraft. People, the infantry. I mean, I was in the army, I was in the infantry, and we think very highly of ourselves, but they're not the centerpiece of major battles between militaries.

If it's targeting you, you can't stop being a person. And so the risks to combatants, to civilians, I think are much more severe. So that could be one approach. The US State Department recently led over 50 countries to come together in a political declaration. So not a legally binding statement, but nevertheless, an international statement surrounding responsible use of military AI."

So yeah, exactly, it's a safeguard on nuclear weapons to make sure that they are only used by an authorized person when authorized by whatever their national authority is. And the US has helped, as you said, spread that technology to other nuclear states because it's not in our interest for their nuclear weapons to fall in the wrong hands."

        text: "So Paul, one of the things you write about in your book is around how AI changes the game of war in the same way that when you let humans play Go for thousands of years, they play it a certain way, they have certain strategies. When they play chess, the same thing. And then when you suddenly introduce AI, the AI discovers a new move that no humans ever done. In Go, it was move 37. You reference in your work the recent examples of dogfighting simulations where you have an AI F-16, I think, what happens, what new moves sort of are discovered by AI systems that humans wouldn't do, and how does that change the game of aerial dogfight?"

        text: 'Oh, absolutely right. We see the same phenomena with military systems. So a couple years ago, DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Department sort of Department of Mad Scientists that do kind of crazy experiments, they trained an AI agent to compete in a dogfighting competition. So they started out with a whole set of different companies in a simulator. The winner was a small startup called Heron Systems that beat out defense giant Lockheed Martin in the finals, and then they went head-to-head against a human, experienced fighter pilot, and they absolutely crushed the human. Now, some caveats are worth their, it was important here, it was in a simulator and not in the real world. There were a couple of things that were simplified for the simulator, but nevertheless, they are now actually flying subsequent iterations of AI agents in real world aircraft, in F-16s, and doing simulated dogfights in the real world. So this technology has matured.'

So in particular, one of the things that the AI agent did was as the aircraft are circling each other, there's a moment where the aircraft are nose to nose and they're racing at each other at hundreds of miles an hour, and there's a split-second opportunity to get off a gunshot to take out the enemy. Now, humans don't make this shot. It's almost impossible for humans. In fact, it's banned in training because it's dangerous to even try because you risk a mid-air collision as you're racing head-to-head at this other aircraft, at hundreds of miles an hour. Well, the AI system very much could"

Humans just can't do it. But it highlights how, as in other areas, the value of AI is not just being better than humans, but also fighting differently. And it opens up a new space of possibilities. And in fact, when you look at gaming environments at StarCraft and Dota 2 and Chess and Go and other things, you see a lot of commonalities of ways in which AI systems play differently than humans."

And this is something that chess grandmasters have talked about with Alpha Zero, for example, that it's able to balance moves across the board better than often humans can. We often see by some of these AI agents very rapid shifts in tactics and aggression. We see this in poker, for example, where they're able to finely calibrate the risks that they're performing and which certainly would've tremendous advantages in warfare. And so there's certainly a tremendous space of opportunity of AI changing warfare in very significant ways."

Because otherwise you lose? And isn't that part of that control problem in and of itself, is that both sides are de facto racing towards implementing these systems that we can't control?"

Which is in the short term, sure, we integrate AI and it makes militaries more effective, but, sort of, where's the endpoint here? And the endpoint is one where a lot of functions are automated and the combat is in the hands of AI, and humans are still being killed. To be clear, I don't think there's a future where we envision, that I would envision of these bloodless wars of robots fighting robots. I mean, that would be great, but I think the unfortunate reality is that we'll see in the future, humans still fighting humans, but with robots and maybe autonomous weapons, the same way that humans fight humans with missiles and aircraft today. And the reality is that there will need to be real human costs to warfare, for wars to end. And so we'll still be on the receiving end of some of this technology, but if we continue to lose control over it, I think that's a very terrifying future to imagine when we could see these potentially really"

        text: "Yeah, I think maybe to just talk a little bit about timeframes, I actually think that in the next five to 10 years that there will be changes. We'll see more autonomy. We'll probably see the introduction of autonomous weapons at least in a limited fashion. But I think the changes will be modest. Militaries are moving quite slowly on integrating AI for better or worse, depending I guess on your point of view. But they're pretty far behind the civilian sector in the space. But over the long run, over maybe the next several decades, I think the changes are likely to be quite profound. At least as significant as the changes that the industrial revolution brought to warfare, where we saw that the introduction of industrial-age technology dramatically increased the physical scale of warfare, of the mechanization that entire societies could bring to World War II, for example. Mobilizing their industry for war, bringing enormous amounts of firepower, destroying, even before nuclear weapons, really entire cities in Europe and Asia."

        text: "And then AI is likely to do something similar to the cognitive aspects of warfare, accelerating the speed and tempo of war, of decision-making. Slowly pushing humans out of the loop. And I think the risk here is that if we do nothing, we end up in a situation where we have militaries that are quite effective and then go out and fight wars that affect us and that have real human consequences but that humans are not in control of once they begin. That we could see situations where machines escalate wars in ways that humans aren't prepared for, even start wars or cause crises to spiral out of control, that it makes it more challenging to limit conflicts and it makes it more challenging to end wars. It's frankly hard for humans oftentimes to end wars because of political commitments and because leaders don't maybe recognize when they're losing."

        text: "But if you add in a layer where they have lost the ability to control their military forces effectively, that gets much, much more challenging. And we've been fortunate enough to live for almost a century now without a large scale global war, but the consequences of such a war would be absolutely catastrophic to humanity even if it were not in a nuclear space. I mean, the scale of destruction that we have already in our inventory, if we really were to see great powers mobilized for war, would cause enormous human suffering. And I don't think that we should take for granted the peace that we live in and we want to be mindful of how emerging technology is changing some of those dynamics. And if we do things right, the goal would be to find a way to skate through these dangers. I think they'll continue to hang over our head just the same way they do with nuclear weapons."

We don't know what the future holds, and we don't know that we'll be able to look 70 years from now and say that remains true. But we try to find a way to navigate through those kinds of threats and have as stable as possible a situation. And with autonomy and AI, if we can come up with a set of rules that countries can agree upon that are pragmatic, that are realistic, that take into account the realities of warfare and how militaries fight and that are achievable, then maybe we can find ways to buy down some of that risk and reduce it and avoid some of the most catastrophic harms."
