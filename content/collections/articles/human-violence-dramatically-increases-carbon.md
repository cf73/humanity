The UN special rapporteur for human rights and the environment, says: “This research helps us understand the immense magnitude of military emissions  -–  from preparing for war, carrying out war and rebuilding after war. Armed conflict pushes humanity even closer to the precipice of climate catastrophe, and is an idiotic way to spend our shrinking carbon budget."'
