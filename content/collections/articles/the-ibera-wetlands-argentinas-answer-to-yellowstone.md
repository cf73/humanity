To one side, a cocoi heron picked its way across lilypads in search of frogs, its long-feathered plumes rising and falling in the soft breeze. On the other, a family of capybara stood partly submerged in the mud, while a languid yacaré caiman warmed itself nearby, mouth agape. Here in Iberá, every part of the aquatic landscape is seemingly filled with life.'

The couple began purchasing large tracts of land from cattle ranchers, initially with the aim of protecting them. But when they saw that many longstanding Iberá residents – such as the jaguar, giant otter, tapir and giant anteater – had completely disappeared, and other species, such as the pampas deer and ocelot, were on the brink of the same fate, they realised they had to do more.'

"But when Doug and I came to Iberá and saw how many species were missing, it was a real epiphany. We soon came to understand that we weren''t simply in the business of creating national parks, but that in places like Iberá, there was a need and obligation to restore entire ecosystems. We realised we had to rewild, and that was a whole new ballgame."'

Elk and deer numbers, which had soared in the absence of predation, began to return to natural levels, overgrazed trees recovered, and a wide range of wildlife populations rebounded."

As the scale of Iberá's wildlife depletion became apparent, the couple's rewilding plans rapidly snowballed."

        text: "In January 2021, a milestone moment saw conservationists on San Alonso release two four-month-old jaguar cubs and their mother into the Great Iberá Park. Following further releases, Iberá's current wild jaguar population stands at 12, with four cubs now born outside captivity. With the carrying capacity of the park estimated to be around 100 animals, and releases ongoing, Iberá could soon become one of the best places in the world to see these majestic big cats in the wild, boosting the appeal of the wetlands even further."

        text: "\"If Doug were still alive today, I like to think he'd be happy with the progress we're making,\" said Sebastián Di Martino, Rewilding Argentina's conservation director. \"Just like the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone, we've tried things in Iberá that have never been attempted before. Not everything has worked out, but we're on our way to restoring and rebalancing the local ecosystem, which is benefitting nature and humans. I invite everyone to come here and see.\""
