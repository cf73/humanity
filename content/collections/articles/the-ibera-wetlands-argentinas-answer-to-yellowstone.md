        text: 'Three decades ago, Iberá (which means "shining waters" in the local Indigenous Guaraní language) was a degraded backwater that was virtually unknown outside Argentina. Years of commercial foresting, illegal hunting and cattle ranching had taken a toll on the land and thrown the ecosystem off balance. Today, thanks to a transformational rewilding initiative, it has become one of South America''s premier wildlife-watching destinations.'
