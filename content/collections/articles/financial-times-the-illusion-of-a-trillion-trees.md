The Albertine Rift is one of the most biodiverse regions in Africa with mountains, deep green forests, savannahs and great lakes spanning 1,000km through six countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The region is home to the most “endemic” — found in only one place — species of vertebrates on the continent's mainland. Many are endangered."

For the latter, allowing trees and shrubs to naturally regenerate is seen as engendering the most biodiverse and resilient ecosystem. Many of the pledges do mention “assisted regeneration” as well as active “afforestation”, but 31 of the companies still pledge to actively plant specific numbers of trees.'
