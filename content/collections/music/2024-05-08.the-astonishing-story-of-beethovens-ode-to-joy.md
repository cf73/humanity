Walking had always been his primary laboratory for creative problem-solving  - so the morning stroll unspooled into a long half-conscious walk along the Danube. In a classic manifestation of the self-forgetting that marks the intense creative state now known as "flow," Beethoven lost track of time, of distance, of the demands of his own body.'
