title: '"...define their humanity in terms of possession..."'
quotation: |-
  “World citizenship is impossible when the powerful define their humanity in terms of possession, rather than the goods of the soul.”

  More to highlight from her speech:   “A culture of extended compassion…”  “To decode the suffering of another…for lives both near and far.”
