quotation: |-
  "The great question is: can global war now be outlawed from the world? If so, it would mark the greatest advance in civilization since the Sermon on the Mount. It would lift at one stroke the darkest shadow which has engulfed mankind from the beginning. 

  "It would not only remove fear and bring security; it would not only create new moral and spiritual values; it would produce an economic wave of prosperity that would raise the world's standard of living beyond anything ever dreamed of by man."
