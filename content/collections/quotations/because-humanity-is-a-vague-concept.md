title: '"...because humanity is a vague concept..."'
quotation: "\"The big challenge is education  --  an inner education so that the person identifies himself with 'humanity', rather than with the in-group. Now, that isn't easy because humanity is a vague concept, and the in-group is what you're experiencing."
