title: '"Only when an ideal of peace..."'
quotation: |-
  Only when an ideal of peace is born in the minds of the peoples will the institutions set up to maintain this peace effectively fulfill the function expected of them.

  So let us dedicate ourselves like Einstein did when he said,
  ‘I am not only a pacifist but a militant pacifist. I am willing to fight for peace. Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war.’
