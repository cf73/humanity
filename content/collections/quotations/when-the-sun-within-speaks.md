title: '"...when the sun within speaks...'
quotation: |-
  "When the sun within speaks, when love reaches out its hand and places it upon another, any power the stars and planets might have upon us, any fears you can muster can become so rightfully insignificant.

  "What one heart can do for another heart, is there any beauty in the world that can match this? Brotherhood, sisterhood, humanity becomes the joy and the emancipation."
