  Louis Brandeis  (1956 - 1941)  Supreme Court Justice.
  According to historian Heather Cox Richardson (3/31/24), Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg often quoted Justice Brandeis’s famous line, saying she advised people to “fight for the things you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you.”
