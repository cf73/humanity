The Foresight model was developed by DRC and IBM with funding from the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and currently funded by ECHO. The model uses the historical relationships and patterns in the data on 148 displacement relevant indicators from 18 different open sources to, with a high degree of accuracy, forecast the total number of forcibly displaced people one to three years into the future.

The model has been employed to forecast the cumulative number of people displaced from 26 countries1 that have ongoing and evolving displacement crises. These countries account for approximately 92% of all global displacement.'
