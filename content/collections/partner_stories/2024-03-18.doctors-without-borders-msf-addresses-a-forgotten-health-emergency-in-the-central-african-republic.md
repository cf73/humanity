For years, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has repeated calls for more action from governments and humanitarian organizations. Yet the situation has continued to worsen, and our teams and the communities we serve are left wondering: Where is everyone?'

At the beginning of 2023, Dr. Sabio—a former MSF doctor in the city of Bangassou—took over the management of the hospital, which is meant to handle surgical complications in a volatile area near Nzacko, in the northwestern part of the Mbomou prefecture.'

There is no electricity, no ambulance, and beds without mattresses. When I arrived, there wasn''t even a thermometer, blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, or glucometer. The pharmacy was empty, too."'

Despite the hospital’s size, there are fewer than 10 patients, and the hospital is eerie and silent. Chickens roam the corridors and wards, weaving between broken scales and rusty tables. Except for the vaccinations and referrals provided by MSF, the facility receives no other support. Patients know that despite Dr. Sabio’s goodwill, the lack of human and material resources means that they are unlikely to find the medical help they need.\_"

We have no electricity, preventing us from performing ultrasounds or X-rays. The operating theater is virtually bare, equipped with only a small solar panel to power two lightbulbs. When patients need medicine, we have to send them to the local market and hope they find something.\"\_"
