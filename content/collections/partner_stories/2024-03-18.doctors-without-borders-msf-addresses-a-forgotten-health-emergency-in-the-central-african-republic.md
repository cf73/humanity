        text: 'Nadia had to travel more than 60 miles to reach the MSF-supported hospital because the hospitals near her home did not have the insulin needed to treat Guy’s type 1 diabetes. Fortunately, after several weeks of care, Guy was ready to go home. However, because he will need insulin for the rest of his life—which is only available from MSF at Bangassou Hospital—Nadia decided to move her family closer to the hospital to ensure her son has access to care.'

        text: "Friend, Nadia and Guy’s experience is just one of the countless stories of our patients who would not otherwise have access to care without MSF. Around the world, only half of the people living with type 1 diabetes have access to insulin. MSF teams are working every day to care for patients and ensure they can access the medication they need.\_"
