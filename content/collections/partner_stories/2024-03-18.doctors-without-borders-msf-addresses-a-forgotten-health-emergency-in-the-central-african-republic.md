        text: "In a country of 5.5 million people, accessing health care is all but impossible and life expectancy is little more than 54 years in the Central African Republic (CAR). Less than half of the country's health care facilities are fully operational, and the ratio of doctors to people is one of the lowest in the world, with only 0.6 doctors for every 10,000 people. \_"

        text: 'Nadia had to travel more than 60 miles to reach the MSF-supported hospital because the hospitals near her home did not have the insulin needed to treat Guy’s type 1 diabetes. Fortunately, after several weeks of care, Guy was ready to go home. However, because he will need insulin for the rest of his life—which is only available from MSF at Bangassou Hospital—Nadia decided to move her family closer to the hospital to ensure her son has access to care.'
