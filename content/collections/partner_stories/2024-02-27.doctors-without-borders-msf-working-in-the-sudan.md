Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are treating people injured in the fighting—along with providing maternal, pediatric, and other health care—in hospitals throughout the country. A member of our team in Sudan, Dr. Mohammed Bashir, shares below an account of providing health care in Sudan.'

People have fled the violence only to find themselves almost destitute in informal camps.\_"

That is why in Umdawanban, one of the hospitals I have covered, our team has been supporting the maternity team, assisting in over 1,500 births since last July. But across the country, many maternity services have not been regularly functional, leaving pregnant women facing life-threatening complications without access to emergency obstetric care. And where health care services are available, the quality of care remains a concern.'

Some of these concerns predate the conflict, but all of them have worsened because of it. Sudan has a troubling history of outbreaks such as measles and meningitis. These highly contagious diseases can be prevented through vaccination, but without it they can be fatal, especially in young children. One factor that puts children particularly at risk is malnutrition, which impairs the immune system.'

When the conflict erupted, it was unclear if it would be possible to continue our support there, but with the determination of a core team, there has been no gap in services. Last year we delivered 40,000 medical consultations to refugees as well as to the host community, and assisted 507 women to give birth safely. Our determination is shared: At Um Rakuba, I’ve seen first-hand the important role that local volunteers and community midwives are playing.'
