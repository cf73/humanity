        text: 'N’DJAMENA/GENEVA – Hepatitis E is spreading through refugee camps in eastern Chad where more than 550,000 Sudanese fleeing the conflict in neighbouring Sudan have taken shelter, warns Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).

        text: 'MSF teams working in Adré, Aboutengue, Metché and Al-Acha camps have seen a surge in cases of hepatitis E, which are directly linked to inadequate sanitation and people’s limited access to clean water. To date, MSF has recorded a staggering 954 cases of hepatitis E among refugees, including 11 pregnant women; four patients have died. Most cases (469) have been in Adré camp, where 122,000 people are waiting to be relocated to more permanent refugee camps. Our teams have also recorded 292 cases in Aboutengue, 132 in Metche and 41 in Al-Acha camps.'
