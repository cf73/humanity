Although there is no cure, there is a safe and effective vaccine  --  one which Rotary and our partners are using\_to immunize over 2.5 billion children worldwide."

Let us all recommit now, and achieve Rotary’s dream of a world free of this debilitating disease. By working together, we can give the world one less infectious disease to worry about once and for all.'
