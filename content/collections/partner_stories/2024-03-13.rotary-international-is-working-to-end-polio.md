        text: "Most know it as poliovirus. The virus is spread person to person, typically through contaminated water. It can attack the nervous system, and\_in some instances, lead to paralysis. Although there is no cure, there is a safe and effective vaccine  --  one which Rotary and our partners are using\_to immunize over 2.5 billion children worldwide."
