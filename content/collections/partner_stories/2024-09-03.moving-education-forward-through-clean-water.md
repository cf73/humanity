        text: "When she started, there were only two classrooms: One hut, and one tin shed. They were filled with 200 students, mostly boys. But today, 375 students (mostly girls!) and 12 teachers call this school home. And thanks to a new rainwater harvesting system funded by supporters like you, they no longer have to worry about where their water will come from each\_day."

        text: "In addition to the water system, this project also included new restrooms. For girls, who make up two-thirds of the student body, this is especially important. Menstrual health is often considered taboo, leading some girls to leave school or even drop out when they get their periods. But now, with clean water and private facilities, they can stay in school all day. One student told us, “Now, I believe the female students will achieve everything they want to achieve in\_life.”"
