        text: 'Six years after the start of the violent conflict in northern Mozambique, people in Cabo Delgado still live in fear. In 2024 alone, over 80,000 people had to flee attacks by armed groups. Displaced people are in urgent need of food, shelter, relief items, and health care, including mental health care.'

        text: '“Displaced people often have been highly traumatized by the violence,” said Esperança Chinhanja, a psychologist with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Macomia, one of the most affected districts of Cabo Delgado. “Some people experience anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, isolation, and recurring thoughts. Some share that they have lost the meaning of life and mention suicidal thoughts.”'

He is currently staying in a camp in Macomia village, about 45 km from his hometown. “When we heard shots being fired, we started running,” he shared while visiting an MSF clinic. “This was the fourth time fleeing attacks in my village since 2020. We don’t have any food and we are relying on the generosity of others to eat. I have lost so much weight that I do not even recognize my body—my pants are falling off as they don’t fit any longer. At night I can’t sleep between being hungry and haunted by the memories of the attacks.”'

The last attacks were the most brutal as they happened repeatedly for two weeks. I have been in a displacement center since I arrived in Macomia. Here, I am providing support to pregnant women from my community who also fled the attacks, and I refer the most serious cases to MSF clinics. This is what keeps me going.”'

I saw my house being burned down, we lost everything we had on that day. My family and I fled to the bush and walked for two days. Since then, I have never been the same and I am still struggling with panic attacks, insomnia, and I want to be alone most of the time. I find my strength to continue living from my children and trying to find food for us. I am working in other people’s fields, and they give me dried cassava in exchange.”'
