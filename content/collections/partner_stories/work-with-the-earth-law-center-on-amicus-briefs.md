        text: 'The Elwha River remains the site of the biggest dam removal and river restoration in history, with the Federal Government spending over $327 million on restoration of the Elwha Watershed post dam-removal. Yet, older, structurally complex, naturally regenerated, and uniquely carbon-dense forests, termed “legacy forests” on state [Washington Department of Natural Resources (“DNR”)] managed forest lands in the Elwha River Watershed are at imminent risk of being logged. There are over 3,000 acres of unprotected legacy forests in, and contiguous to, the Elwha River Watershed, with approximately 850 in the watershed itself. In 2023-2024, there are over 200 acres of legacy forests in the Elwha River Watershed slated for logging.'

        text: "The Elwha legacy forests tell an interconnected story. Forest health is tied to the health of endangered species like Chinook Salmon, and in turn, the Southern Resident Orcas. The surrounding forests also play a crucial role in protecting the water quality. The trees act as natural filters, removing pollutants and contaminants and help prevent soil erosion and sedimentation. Additionally, the root systems of trees in legacy forests help to regulate water flow and reduce the risk of flooding. The Elwha River also supplies Port Angeles' sole source of drinking water and along its banks are many culturally significant sites for the lower Elwha Klallam people."

These forests are important because they preserve the genetic, biological, and ecological ‘legacies’ of the natural lowland forests that once dominated Western Washington. One of these critical older forests in the Elwha River Watershed called the “Aldwell” was identified to be logged last year.'

In particular, varieties of Agarikon (Fomitopsis officinalis aka Laricifomes officinalis) are now known to have potent antiviral properties. But not all of them. We are still deep in investigating the anti-flu, anti-herpes, and anti-pox viral properties of this mushroom, which many mycologists describe as the longest living, if not the longest living mushroom in Western North America. Without these old growth forests, this mushroom species is absent. I strongly urge that old growth forest reserves hosting these rare mushrooms be spared --- or at least considered -- for their contributions to future medicine. Once we lose these libraries, we may lose remedies for protecting ourselves from pandemics, which most scientists agree, will be coming with increasing frequency and severity. Our old growth forests are critical, in my opinion, for our national defense."'
