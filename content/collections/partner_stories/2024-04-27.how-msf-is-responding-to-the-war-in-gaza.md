        text: "More than 33,000\_Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and over 75,000 wounded, and thousands are estimated to be buried under the wreckage. Three-quarters of the population—1.7 million people—have been forcibly displaced by this war, the majority crammed into the south. Water and food are scarce. Essential supplies like fuel and electricity are scant. And while the threat of disease and starvation grows and the bombardment continues, lifesaving health care is increasingly inaccessible. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in Gaza have witnessed firsthand how this war has turned a chronic humanitarian crisis into a catastrophe."
