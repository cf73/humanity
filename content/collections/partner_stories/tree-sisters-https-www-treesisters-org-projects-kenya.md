        text: "Located in the foothills of Mount Kenya, this project aims to reforest and restore a vital water catchment that delivers an estimated 40% of the country's water and gathers communities around rehabilitating their forests and agricultural lands. While only 7% of Kenya is covered by trees, making it one of Africa's countries most affected by deforestation, its forests are crucial for wildlife, freshwater resources, and the materials they provide to local people. Kenya's rural communities heavily depend on forests for their livelihoods. Yet, with increased demand for wood for domestic and industrial uses, land development, settlements, and cultivation, Mount Kenya's forests are threatened with extinction."
