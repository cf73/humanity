        text: 'After working as a surgeon in low-resource settings in emergencies around the world, I thought nothing could shock me. But the horror medical staff and their patients have endured in places like Al-Shifa and Al-Awda hospitals will stay with me. Surgeries have been conducted without painkillers and one of our surgeons Dr Mahmoud Abu Nujaila was killed in an air strike after writing on the surgery whiteboard: “Whoever stands until the end, will tell the story. We did what we could.”'

They also report the lack of water and its overall poor quality, leading to life-threatening diseases.'
