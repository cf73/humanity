        text: "The presence in the ocean of microplastics (MPs)--small particles of plastic less than 5 mm in size--has emerged as a major cause for concern around the world. WHOI scientists\_first identified\_MPs in\_coastal\_and open ocean environments in the 1970s and subsequently contributed to seminal research on the presence of MPs in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre that was\_published in 2010. In 2017, WHOI launched a marine microplastics program, with goals that included 1) convening an\_international workshop\_to identify the key knowledge gaps and research questions concerning microplastic pollution in the ocean and 2) building a long-term, collaborative, interdisciplinary research program to address these questions and provide a better understanding of the MP problem and its possible solutions."

        text: "Questions surrounding microplastics in the ocean are inherently complex and cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. As a result,\_WHOI researchers\_are working individually and collaboratively to conduct cross-disciplinary research to understand the fate and impacts of marine microplastics and their much smaller cousin, nanoplastics. The research is supported by\_partners and sponsors\_that include federal agencies, foundations, and individuals. WHOI scientists and engineers are also providing leadership in the microplastics research field by organizing\_events\_and giving\_presentations\_to a variety of audiences."
