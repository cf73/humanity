  Let's plunge right in to rising seas, with a deep dive into humanity’s climate crisis. The title says it all: “Drawdown. The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warning.”

  Edited by Paul Hawken, produced by hundreds of outstanding writers and researchers from across the continents, this is indeed a visionary and comprehensive resource for understanding both the challenges and solutions of this climate change era, the Anthropocene. This is truly an exciting and hopeful read.
