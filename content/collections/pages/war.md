  So how exactly can humanity at last end the scourge of war? How do we meet such a seemingly impossible challenge, particularly in the face of the cynic, the terrorist and the fascist, who will always be among us?

  And from there...may it flow into dramatic enlightenment across the continents...fueled by the natural and deep dedication of the vast majority of humankind towards living in peace.
