        text: 'Since 1984, The Humanity Initiative  --  as part of our conversation with the world  --  has paid close attention to the work of leading humanitarian non-profits. Now, with the help of Charity Navigator, we have chosen the top thirty to recommend most strongly as part of your research on positive change, as well as to investigate closely for a possible donation.  We also soon will be making it easy for you, if you prefer, to aggregate several donations with one payment, saving time and trouble. We also of course will have direct links to both the volunteer and donation pages of each non-profit.'
