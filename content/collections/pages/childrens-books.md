title: "Children's Books"
challenge_intro_text: |-
  Children’s literature about the Earth and humanity's many challenges on it is becoming increasingly popular.

  New books cover the changes the planet is undergoing; the necessity of caring for it; challenges for wildlife; respecting and loving people who may seem vastly different from ourselves; human rights; sports; cultural differences; and on to many more “non-fiction” concerns. 

  So THI created this collection of the best of these books, to offer them as the center of what will become an accessible, fun and instructive oasis for children. We in fact are looking for volunteers across the globe to help make this happen. Please contact peace@humanity.org if you are interested.
