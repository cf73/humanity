title: "Children's Books"
challenge_intro_text: |-
  Venturing happily into the diverse horizons of positive change, children’s books about the Earth and humanity's many challenges are becoming increasingly popular.

  They cover changes the planet is undergoing and the necessity of caring for it; challenges for wildlife; respecting and loving people who may seem vastly different from ourselves; human rights; sports; cultural differences; and on to many more “non-fiction” concerns. 

  So THI created this collection of the best of these books, to offer them as the center of what will become an accessible, fun and instructive oasis for children. We in fact are looking for volunteers across the globe to help make this happen. Please contact peace@humanity.org if you are interested.
