  Earth rise! Voices of wisdom, kindness, courage and humor.

  Our voice is our liaison to life, our distinguishing tune, our hallmark, our trace, our touch one to another. Be it spoken, written, whispered, implied or sung; be it gestured, danced or played; be it offered on still wings of silence or in the intimacy of eyes alone, it is our human touchstone.

  In these defining years, facing mutltiple planet-wide crises, we have gathered below an enlightenment of known and unknown voices encouraging us to act on the understanding that we are profoundly, inescapably and urgently in these Earthly struggles together.
