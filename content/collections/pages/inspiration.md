challenge_intro_text: |-
  Our distinguishing tune, our hallmark, our trace, our touch one to another  --  our voice is our liaison to life, our wellspring of wisdom, kindness, courage and humor. 

  Be it spoken, written, whispered, implied or sung; be it gestured, danced or played; be it offered on still wings of silence or in the intimacy of eyes alone, it is our human touchstone.

  In these reckoning years, facing multiple planet-wide crises, we offer this aspirational oasis as an enlightenment of voices known and unknown, encouraging us to act on the understanding that we are profoundly, inescapably in these Earthly struggles together.
