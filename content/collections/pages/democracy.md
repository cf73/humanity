  On the final day of the American Constitutional Convention of 1787, as people gathered in colonial Philadelphia to await news of what exactly the founders had crafted, Elizabeth Willing Powel, a well known salonaire of that era and a close confidant of George Washington, inquired of Ben Franklin, “What have we created, Dr. Franklin, a republic or a monarchy?” His famous reply: “A republic…if you can keep it.”

  Little could Franklin have known that he also would be speaking to most countries around the globe 235 years later, for the world now anxiously nurtures increasingly fragile democratic experiments in the face of expanding authoritarianism.

            text: 'Democracy  —  in all its many unpredictable forms  —  has proven to be the most enduring answer to an eternal question for humankind: how the heck can I get along well with my neighbors? For the world is indeed imperfect; we all have neighbors at some point like  “…that new lot down the street, with all their noise and disrespect.”'

            text: 'Whenever we need to face any of the million challenges of living well together, democracy raises its hand, quietly, in response: “Bring me your disagreement, your misunderstanding; bring me that terrible thing your neighbors did. Share with me,” democracy says, “your confusion over legal rights or medical care or how to build a school that works best for everyone in your village. I will give you well-considered answers, based on much experience with the law of our land. I will do my best to preserve the dignity of humanhood.” '
