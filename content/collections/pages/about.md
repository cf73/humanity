  The Humanity Initiative was founded in 1984 by Tony Balis, with the mission of "...encouraging people to understand this planet as our common home." 

  Initially we published a journal of non-fiction and photography, called 'humanity.' Our first contributor was His Holiness The Dalai Lama, who happily agreed, during a private audience, to Tony's request to write a letter to the children of the world. 

  In 1997 we ceased publishing our journal in favor of the internet. In 2024, we re-imagined our strategy  --  www.ourhumanity.org.  --  to directly address humankind's most urgent challenges and to inspire each of us to take action.
