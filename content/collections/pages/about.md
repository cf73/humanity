  The Humanity Initiative was founded in 1984 by Tony Balis, with the mission of "...encouraging people to understand this planet as our common home." 

  Initially we published a journal of non-fiction and photography, called 'humanity.' Our first contributor was His Holiness The Dalai Lama, who happily agreed, in a private audience, to Tony's request write a letter to the children of the world. 

  In 1997 we ended the journal in favor of an internet site, www.humanity.org  --  which we have totally re-imagined this year to better address the wilder and more urgent horizons of positive change.
