  The Humanity Initiative was founded in 1984 by Tony Balis, with the mission of encouraging people to understand this planet as our common home. 

  Initially we published a journal of non-fiction and photography, called 'humanity.' Our first contributor was His Holiness The Dalai Lama, who agreed to Tony's request write a letter to the children of the world. 

  In 1997 we ended the journal in favor of the internet. We offer insight on humanity's three most urgent crises: ending war, saving democracy, and solving climate change. 

  We also include detailed information on thirty leading humanitarian non-profits, on how best to volunteer, and including an easy way to aggregate and customize donations among them.
