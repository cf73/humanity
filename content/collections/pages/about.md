  This is an oasis, not a news destination. We have designed a comfortable and intriguing place to linger, to sharpen your instincts about the fate of the world and discover ways to help save it, not least to do so in ways that nourish your favorite causes and introduce you to new ones. 

  We want you to think, to stare out the window and consider what you have just read or heard or seen, to get excited about joining the world of positive change, or accelerating your place in it. 



  Ways that honor and hone your skills.... 


  The Humanity Initiative was founded in 1984 by Tony Balis, with the mission of encouraging people to understand this planet as our common home. 

  Initially we published a journal of non-fiction and photography, called 'humanity.' Our first contributor was His Holiness The Dalai Lama, who agreed to Tony's request write a letter to the children of the world. 

  In 1997 we ended the journal in favor of the internet. We offer insight on humanity's three most urgent crises: ending war, saving democracy, and solving climate change. 

  We also include detailed information on thirty leading humanitarian non-profits, on how best to volunteer, and including an easy way to aggregate and customize donations among them.
