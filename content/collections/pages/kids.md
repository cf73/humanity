title: "Children's Books"
challenge_intro_text: |-
  Venturing happily into the diverse horizons of positive change, children’s books about Earth and humanity's challenges are becoming increasingly popular.

  They cover changes the planet is undergoing and the necessity of caring for it; challenges for wildlife; respecting and loving people who may seem vastly different from ourselves; human rights; sports; cultural differences; and on to many more “non-fiction” concerns. 

  So THI created this collection of the best of these books, to offer them as the center of an accessible, fun and instructive oasis for children.
