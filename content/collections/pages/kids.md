title: "Children's books"
challenge_intro_text: |-
  Venturing happily into the diverse horizons of positive change, there are many children’s books about our planet published in the last few years.  

  They cover the changes Earth is undergoing, the necessity of caring for it, the challenges to wildlife, respecting and loving people who may seem vastly different from ourselves, human rights, sports, cultural differences, and on to many more “non-fiction” concerns. 

  So we created this collection of the best of these books, to offer them as the center of an accessible, fun and instructive oasis for children.
