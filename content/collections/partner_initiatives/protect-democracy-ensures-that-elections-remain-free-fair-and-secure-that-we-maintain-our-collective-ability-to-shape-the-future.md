title: 'Protect Democracy ensures that elections remain free, fair, and secure  --  that we maintain our collective ability to shape the future.'

summary: 'Without free, fair, and secure elections, voters have no voice, little control over the direction of a country, and few ways to correct course when things go awry.'
call_to_action: 'Protect Democracy defends the process of holding elections.'
key_facts_that_make_this_urgent: |-
  We defend the process of holding elections by making sure that election officials are allowed to do their work without interference, that election systems are secure, and that politicians are unable to dictate the outcome or manipulate election rules.  

  Second, we protect voters’ ability to participate meaningfully in the process, free from intimidation and harassment.  By ensuring that elections remain free, fair, and secure, we maintain our collective ability to shape the future of the country — or, when needed, to change course. In that, we protect voters’ trust in the results, even when their preferred candidates lose.
