        text: '"Nature connectedness is a measurable psychological construct grounded in science that captures the relationship between people and the rest of the natural world. Not only do those with a high level of nature connectedness enjoy better mental (and physical) health, but studies have shown that they are more likely to act in environmentally friendly ways. Crucial for conservation and climate change efforts globally. But where do we start, and how do we improve our connection with our natural environment?"'
