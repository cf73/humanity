summary: |-
  The world is better than we think. In pockets across the globe, humans are pioneering answers to some of the worldâ€™s most pressing challenges. Ashoka's "Next Now" identifies, supports and lifts up these examples, and the changemakers behind them, helping people and institutions see and build a radically new future.

call_to_action: "Ashoka's Next Now lifts up changemakers"
key_facts_that_make_this_urgent: 'Our planet is in crisis, and we are responsible for it. We have deluded ourselves into thinking that humans are separate from, and superior to, nature. How do we fundamentally rebalance that relationship? How can our economic systems prioritize creating shared wellbeing on a healthy planet? How can we bring unlikely allies and sceptics on board?'
