  Medical staff in Gaza have been enduring the unthinkable over the last nearly seven months of war: amputating limbs without anesthesia, treating mass crush and burn injuries with extremely limited supplies, and trying to work as Israeli forces have repeatedly besieged hospitals like Nasser and Al-Shifa. MSF reiterates its call for an immediate and sustained ceasefire to prevent more death and destruction to the lives of people in Gaza.  

  Gaza’s health care workers, including Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff, have been risking their lives to provide medical care. Some, also including MSF colleagues, have been killed or detained. Others have been forced to flee facilities under Israeli forces’ evacuation orders, having to make the unconscionable decision of whether to leave patients behind or save their own lives.  

  Medical staff bear the burden in times of war

  MSF psychiatrist Dr. Audrey McMahon, who recently returned from Palestine, said medical staff in Gaza are working under profound psychological strain. 

  “Many times, because of the bombardments or because of the insecurity, medical staff had to leave patients behind. Many of them have a shared feeling of guilt for not being able to do more,” said McMahon. “Other times, the guilt is about [making] the choice to protect their family first and not go to the hospital to treat patients.” 

  There is constant noise from the drones, which never leave us. Sometimes it’s really hard to sleep. I have this moral obligation to help people around me and I have this other obligation to save my kids.

  DR. RUBA SULIMAN, MSF STAFF
  Among 300 Palestinian MSF staff in Gaza is Dr. Ruba Suliman, who works at Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital. She has been displaced from her home and is living in a shelter in Rafah, southern Gaza, with her husband and two children. 

  “There is constant noise from the drones, which never leave us. Sometimes it’s really hard to sleep,” said Dr. Suliman. “I have this moral obligation to help people around me and I have this other obligation to save my kids.”

  “We are alive, but we are not okay,” she said. “We are tired. Everybody here is devastated.”


  Health care workers in Gaza face the same struggles as the other 2.2 million Palestinians living in the Strip. These doctors, nurses, and emergency responders have also lost their homes and loved ones, and many are living in tents and coping with grief. 

  “It is not just about the house itself, it is about losing all the small things that made you who you are,” said another Palestinian MSF doctor. “My favorite coffee cup, my mother’s pictures, the shoes I liked so much.”

  The psychological toll and human cost

  The intensity and duration of exposure to these traumatic events are shattering the psychological state of many Palestinians in Gaza, including health care workers, some of whom say they come to work to not think about the war. But they nevertheless fear that what they see happening to their patients will happen to them or their loved ones. 

  It is not just about the house itself, it is about losing all the small things that made you who you are: my favorite coffee cup, my mother’s pictures, the shoes I liked so much.
