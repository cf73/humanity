summary: 'Your donations pay for millions of consultations, surgeries, treatments and vaccinations every year. 80% of our financial resources are allocated to fulfilling our social mission: humanitarian programmes (65%); support for our projects and programmes (12%); and 3% to awareness-raising, the Access Campaign, and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi).'

key_facts_that_make_this_urgent: |-
  The consequences of war can be vast and catastrophic; from death and violence; to long-term lifechanging injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder; destroyed infrastructure and healthcare systems; as well as people being uprooted and forced to leave everything behind.  

  In war zones, our teams endeavour to assess and treat the most pressing needs; we don’t take sides but address people’s medical and humanitarian needs first and foremost. We also speak out about the situations faced by the people we strive to help, including in war zones. We will continue to provide assistance to people in distress, regardless of their race, religion, creed or political convictions.
