        text: "Questions surrounding microplastics in the ocean are inherently complex and cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. As a result,\_WHOI researchers\_are working individually and collaboratively to conduct cross-disciplinary research to understand the fate and impacts of marine microplastics and their much smaller cousin, nanoplastics. The research is supported by\_partners and sponsors\_that include federal agencies, foundations, and individuals. WHOI scientists and engineers are also providing leadership in the microplastics research field by organizing\_events\_and giving\_presentations\_to a variety of audiences."

summary: 'In 2017, WHOI launched a marine microplastics program, convening an international workshop to identify key knowledge gaps and research questions, while also building a long-term, collaborative, interdisciplinary research program to provide better understanding of microplastics and possible solutions.'
call_to_action: 'Join WHOI in solving the microplastics challenge.'
key_facts_that_make_this_urgent: 'The presence of microplastics and nanoplastics in the oceans is a worldwide concern. WHOI has launched an interdisciplinary research program to understand the fate and impacts of plastics in the marine environment. Our research involves a diverse group of scientists, engineers, students, postdoctoral researchers, and science communicators. We invite you to explore microplastics@whoi.edu and contact any of the team members to inquire about opportunities to become involved in and support our research effort.'
