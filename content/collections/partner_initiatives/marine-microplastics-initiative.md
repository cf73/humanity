        text: 'The presence of microplastics and nanoplastics in the oceans is a worldwide concern. To help address this pressing problem, WHOI has launched an interdisciplinary research program to understand the fate and impacts of plastics in the marine environment. Our research is supported by both public and private sources and involves a diverse group of scientists, engineers, students, postdoctoral researchers, and science communicators. We invite you to explore these pages and contact any of the team members to inquire about opportunities to become involved in and support our research effort.'

        text: 'The ocean is a defining feature of our planet and crucial to life on Earth, yet it remains one of the planet’s last unexplored frontiers. For this reason, WHOI scientists and engineers are committed to understanding all facets of the ocean as well as its complex connections with Earth’s atmosphere, land, ice, seafloor, and life—including humanity. This is essential not only to advance knowledge about our planet, but also to ensure society’s long-term welfare and to help guide human stewardship of the environment. WHOI researchers are also dedicated to training future generations of ocean science leaders, to providing unbiased information that informs public policy and decision-making, and to expanding public awareness about the importance of the global ocean and its resources.'

  A Major Hidden Problem
  Microplastics—tiny plastic fragments less than five millimeters in size—are ubiquitous in the global ocean. In fact, an estimated eight million tons of plastics enter our oceans each year, yet only one percent can be seen floating at the surface. Where the rest ends up is not well understood.
call_to_action: 'Join WHOI in solving the microplastics challenge.'
