summary: |-
  We think our kids are safe in school online. But many of them are being surveilled, and parents have often been kept in the dark. Kids are priceless, not products.

call_to_action: 'Human Rights Watch monitors educational tech data.'
key_facts_that_make_this_urgent: |-
  On school days, 9-year-old Rodin wakes up every morning at 8 a.m. in Istanbul, Turkey. 
  Unbeknownst to him, an invisible swarm of tracking technologies surveil his online interactions throughout his day. Within milliseconds of Rodin logging into class, his school’s online learning platform begins tracking his physical location. The virtual whiteboard passes along information about his doodling habits to advertising technology (AdTech). When Rodin’s math class is over, trackers follow him outside of his virtual classroom and to the different apps and sites he visits across the internet. The social media platform he uses to post his homework silently accesses his phone’s contact list and downloads personal details about his family and friends. Sophisticated algorithms review this trove of data, enough to piece together an intimate portrait of Rodin in order to figure out how he might be easily influenced.

Each analysis essentially took a snapshot of the prevalence and frequency of tracking technologies embedded in each product on a given date in that window. That prevalence and frequency may fluctuate over time based on multiple factors, meaning that an analysis conducted on later dates might observe variations in the behavior of the products.'

These products monitored or had the capacity to monitor children, in most cases secretly and without the consent of children or their parents, in many cases harvesting data on who they are, where they are, what they do in the classroom, who their family and friends are, and what kind of device their families could afford for them to use.'

Some invisibly tagged and fingerprinted children in ways that were impossible to avoid or get rid of—even if children, their parents, and teachers had been aware and had the desire and digital literacy to do so—without throwing the device away in the trash.'

        text: "Most online learning platforms sent or granted access to children’s data to third-party companies, usually\_advertising technology (AdTech) companies. In doing so, they appear to have\_permitted the sophisticated algorithms of AdTech companies the opportunity to stitch together and analyze these data to guess at a child’s personal characteristics and interests, and to predict what a child might do next and how they might be influenced. Access to these insights could then be sold to anyone—advertisers, data brokers, and others—who sought to target a defined group of people with similar characteristics online."

By using children’s data—extracted from educational settings—to target them with personalized content and advertisements that follow them across the internet, these companies not only distorted children’s online experiences, but also risked influencing their opinions and beliefs at a time in their lives when they are at high risk of manipulative interference. Many more EdTech products sent children’s data to AdTech companies that specialize in behavioral advertising or whose algorithms determine what children see online.'

In response to requests for comment, several EdTech companies denied collecting children’s data. Some companies denied that their products were intended for children’s use,\_or stressed that their virtual classroom pages for children’s use had adequate privacy protections, even if Human Rights Watch’s analysis found that pages adjacent to the virtual classroom pages (such as the login page, home page or adjacent page with children’s content) did not.\_AdTech companies denied knowledge that the data was being sent to them, indicating that in any case it was their clients’ responsibility not to send them children’s data."

With the exception of a single government—Morocco—all governments reviewed in this report endorsed at least one EdTech product that risked or undermined children’s rights. Most EdTech products were offered to governments at no direct financial cost to them; in the process of endorsing and ensuring their wide adoption during Covid-19 school closures, governments offloaded the true costs of providing online education onto children, who were unknowingly forced to pay for their learning with their rights to privacy, access to information, and potentially freedom of thought.'

Of the 42 governments that provided online education to children by building and offering their own EdTech products for use during the pandemic, 39 governments produced products that handled children’s personal data in ways that risked or infringed on their rights. Some of these governments made it compulsory for students and teachers to use their EdTech product, not only subjecting them to the risks of misuse or exploitation of their data, but also making it impossible for children to protect themselves by opting for alternatives to access their education.'

Most EdTech companies did not allow their students to decline to be tracked; most of this monitoring happened secretly, without the child’s knowledge or consent. In most instances, it was impossible for children to opt out of such surveillance and data collection without opting out of compulsory education and giving up on formal learning altogether during the pandemic.'

Companies should inventory and identify all children’s data ingested during the pandemic, and ensure that they do not process, share, or use children’s data for purposes unrelated to the provision of children’s education. AdTech companies should immediately delete any children’s data they received; EdTech companies should work with governments to define clear retention and deletion rules for children’s data collected during the pandemic.'
