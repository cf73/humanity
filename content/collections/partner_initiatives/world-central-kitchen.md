summary: |-
  Supporting communities in times of crisis
  WCK responds to natural disasters, man-made crises, and humanitarian emergencies around the world. We're a team of food first responders, mobilizing with the urgency of now to get meals to the people who need them most. Deploying our model of quick action, leveraging local resources, and adapting in real time, we know that a nourishing meal in a time of crisis is so much more than a plate of food—it's hope, it's dignity, and it's a sign that someone cares.
call_to_action: "Food when it's needed most"

  To start providing meals, as quickly as possible, to people impacted by crises, WCK’s Relief Team works with professional chefs, logistics experts, local restaurants, and other established organizations. 

  Volunteers are also critical in making our work possible! This occasionally includes reaching out to our larger WCK community for support. We aim to work with local leaders from the impacted communities we serve because they have a deep knowledge of the area, culture, and people.
