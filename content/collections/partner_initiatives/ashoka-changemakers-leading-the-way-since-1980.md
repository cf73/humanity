        text: 'As the vice president of key initiatives at Western Union, Bassem Awada collaborated with Ashoka Fellow Marlon Parker and his organization R-Labs to scale-up a youth currency program in South Africa. The program is designed to reward youth in their community for acts of citizenry, allowing them to “bank” these rewards on a mobile phone platform and then redeem this social currency at local vendors. In two weeks time, Bassem worked with the R-Labs team to develop a plan to significantly scale-up the program, and increase the number of young people and vendors involved. In the first four months since his placement ended in November 2015, R-Labs was able to increase their youth participation by more than 100 percent (7,000 youth are now participating), and grow from 10 small business vendors to having 35 who now accept the currency.'
