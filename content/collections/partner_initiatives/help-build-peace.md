        text: 'Policy initiatives that exclude half of the population are likely to fail. Yet this is often how peace works, with women barred from key discussions and decisions. At UN-brokered negotiations, just 23 percent of participants are womenâ€”even though negotiations that involve women are 35 percent more likely to last through 15 years.'

        text: 'The challenge is not just a seat at the table. Despite stereotypes and scarce resources, women-led organizations are often the vanguard of peace, with trust built through steady work. Yet even supportive donors can exclude women from key strategy decisions. Globally, we know that gender equality ties to lower rates of infant mortality and higher GDPs. What would truly equitable partnerships look like, with women-led groups treated as full partners, not just end-of-the-line implementers?'
