        text: "That’s what’s always happened here at Tuskegee.\_Think about those students who made bricks with their bare hands. They did it so that others could follow them and learn on this campus, too. Think about that brilliant scientist who made his lab from a trash pile.\_He did it because he ultimately wanted to help sharecroppers feed their families. Those Airmen who rose above brutal discrimination – they did it so the whole world could see just how high Black folks could soar. That’s the spirit we’ve got to summon to take on the challenges we face\_today.\_\_\_"
