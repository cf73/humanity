Thank you, thank you Wallis Annenberg, and a special thank you to Dean Willow Bay for inviting me today, and to the parents again I say – and faculty, family, friends, graduates… good morning! I want to give a special shout-out because I was happy that Dean Bay invited me, but I was going to be here anyway because one of my lovely daughter girls attends the Annenberg School of Journalism and is getting her Masters today. So I was coming whether I was speaking or not.'

What I’ve learned in all these years is that we’re not supposed to match it or even get locked into resisting or pushing against it. We’re supposed to see this moment in time for what it is. We’re supposed to see through it and transcend it. That is how you overcome hysteria, and that is how you overcome the sniping at one another, the trolling, the mean-spirited partisanship on both sides of the aisle, the divisiveness, the injustices, the out-and-out hatred. You use it. Use this moment to encourage you to embolden you and to literally push you into the rising of your\_life. And to borrow a phrase from my beloved mentor Maya Angelou,"

It’s hard coming up with something to share with you that you haven’t already heard. What can I possibly say? Because any inspiration or guidance I can offer is nothing that your parents or your deans or professors or Siri haven’t already provided. So I’m really here to tell you that I don’t have any new lessons. I don’t have any new lessons. But I often think that it’s not the new lessons but so much as it really learning the old ones again and again. So here are variations on a few grand themes, beginning with this.'
