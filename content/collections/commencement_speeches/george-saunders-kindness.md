Working terrible jobs, like “knuckle-puller in a slaughterhouse?”\_ (And don’t even\_ASK\_what that entails.)\_No. I don’t regret that. Skinny-dipping in a river in Sumatra, a little buzzed, and looking up and seeing like 300 monkeys sitting on a pipeline, pooping down into the river, the river in which I was swimming, with my mouth open, naked?\_And getting deathly ill afterward, and staying sick for the next seven months? Not so much. Do I regret the occasional humiliation?\_Like once, playing hockey in front of a big crowd, including this girl I really liked, I somehow managed, while falling and emitting this weird whooping noise, to score on my own goalie while also sending my stick flying into the crowd, nearly hitting that girl?\_No. I don’t even regret\_that."

After a while, she’d drift away, hair strand still in her mouth.\_At home, I imagined, after school, her mother would say, you know: “How was your day, sweetie?” and she’d say, “Oh, fine.”\_And her mother would say, “Making any friends?” and she’d go, “Sure,\_lots.”"
