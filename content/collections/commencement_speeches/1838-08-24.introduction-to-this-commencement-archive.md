        text: "Since 1984, The Humanity Initiative has monitored commencement speeches. Students nowadays are concerned that we  --  their parents and grandparents  --  have failed them environmentally, politically, socially, and morally in our efforts to leave them with a thriving civilization. Happily, wise and inspirational speeches, no matter how old, still hold insights keenly useful to today's students  --  not to mention to their parents, even now doing our best to make a positive difference."

        text: 'Environmental justice is one of the most frequent topic on the airwaves of positive change.

        text: "In self-defeating preference for material welfare at the sacrifice of sustainable life, we are trashing our only home, whistling past the cosmic graveyard. As we lose bees, we destroy the cycle of life. As we heat glaciers, we flood our cities. As we burn coal, we breathe toxins.\_\_"

That is to say, I’m not certain that somehow, perhaps, a burgeoning ménage a trois of political interests, corporate interests and military interests will not prevail and literally annihilate an inhabitable, humane\_future.”"

Forefront nonprofits like the International Rescue Committee (aiding refugees in crisis) and Ashoka (supporting systemic social change) work at nothing less than\_sustaining humanity’s viable existence on\_Earth."

        text: "As you compose your remarks this spring, consider that you, in effect, are the messengers of this era. And since so many speeches now find traction on the Internet, your potential audience has expanded exponentially, making it even less appealing to hide behind the insulting simplicity of bromides and platitudes. Make no mistake: students worldwide are hearing the sirens. They want to learn how to effect and participate in transformative change. You have a unique opportunity to help them analyze and clarify the challenges\_ahead."
