        text: "Since 1984, The Humanity Initiative has kept track of commencement speeches. Many students now are concerned that we  --  their parents and grandparents  --  have failed them environmentally, politically, socially, and morally in our efforts to leave them with a workable civilization. Happily, wise and inspirational speeches, no matter how old, still carry insights keenly useful to today's students  --  not to mention to their parents, even now doing our best to make a positive difference!"

        text: "Clarion calls for environmental sanity from as far back as Rachel Carson and Aldo Leopold have been proven real and prescient. Yet still we\_cover our ears to scientific fact, shield our hearts from admitting what a dangerous world we are leaving for our children. In naïve and selfish preference for material welfare at the sacrifice of sustainable life, we are trashing our only home, whistling past the cosmic graveyard. As we lose bees, we destroy the cycle of life. As we heat glaciers, we flood our cities. As we burn coal, we breathe toxins.\_\_"

That is to say, I’m not certain that somehow, perhaps, a burgeoning ménage a trois of political interests, corporate interests and military interests will not prevail and literally annihilate an inhabitable, humane\_future.”"

Forefront nonprofits like the International Rescue Committee (aiding refugees in crisis) and Ashoka (supporting systemic social change) work at nothing less than\_sustaining humanity’s viable existence on\_Earth."

        text: "As you compose your remarks this spring, consider that you, in effect, are the messengers of this era. And since so many speeches now find traction on the Internet, your potential audience has expanded exponentially, making it even less appealing to hide behind the insulting simplicity of bromides and platitudes. Make no mistake: students worldwide are hearing the sirens. They want to learn how to effect and participate in transformative change. You have a unique opportunity to help them analyze and clarify the challenges\_ahead."
