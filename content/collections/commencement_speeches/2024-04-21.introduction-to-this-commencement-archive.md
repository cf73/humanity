        text: "You have a new and dramatic challenge this spring: the radical transformation of your audience. Students across the world are worried that their future hangs by a thread. Many are angry that we, their parents and grandparents, have created almost irredeemable catastrophes. We have failed environmentally, politically, socially, morally, and spiritually. Even our air and water are threatened\_ –\_\_not to mention we still stockpile weapons that could destroy life on Earth in\_minutes."

        text: "Only the most myopic and self-serving perceive a comfortable and safe future. This year’s graduates face the harshest reality of any generation in history, more sobering than even the darkest days of World Wars I and\_II, which essentially were assaults on human dignity, kindness and common sense but did not threaten the habitability of the planet\_itself."

        text: "But now, the context for a graduation speech has changed severely. The reason is precise and unavoidable: if humanity cannot create and agree on solutions to our urgent air, water, food and land crises, graduates may well spend their lives in constant struggle, bereft of most blessings now considered\_“normal.”"

        text: "Clarion calls for environmental sanity from as far back as Rachel Carson and Aldo Leopold have been proven real and prescient. Still we\_cover our ears to scientific fact, not to mention shield our hearts from admitting what a dangerous world we are leaving for our children. In naïve and selfish preference for material welfare at the sacrifice of sustainable life, we are trashing our only home, whistling past the cosmic graveyard. As we lose bees, we destroy the cycle of life. As we heat glaciers, we flood our cities. As we burn coal, we breathe toxins.\_\_"

That is to say, I’m not certain that somehow, perhaps, a burgeoning ménage a trois of political interests, corporate interests and military interests will not prevail and literally annihilate an inhabitable, humane\_future.”"

        text: "Now, in 2019, this is nothing less than a planetary reckoning. Spurred, for example, by the courage and clarity of 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thurnburg of Sweden demanding “action and not hope,” or by the gravity of the Parkland High students intent on gun legislation, the world is finally waking to the emergency. In fact, forefront nonprofits like the International Rescue Committee (aiding refugees in crisis) and Ashoka (supporting systemic social change) work at nothing less than\_sustaining humanity’s viable existence on\_Earth."

        text: "So as you compose your remarks this spring, consider that you, in effect, are the messengers of this era. And since many speeches now find traction on the Internet, your potential audience has expanded exponentially, making it even less appealing to hide behind the insulting simplicity of bromides and platitudes. Make no mistake: students worldwide are hearing the sirens. They want to know how to effect and participate in transformative change. You have a unique opportunity to help them analyze and clarify the challenges\_ahead."

It often includes a speech that seeks to put their recent hard (or not so hard) work into the context of their future. Many of us hear one or two commencement addresses as graduates or listen to a handful as spectators. Yet – as we graduate from one year to another, one relationship to another, one experience to another – we always are\_learning."
