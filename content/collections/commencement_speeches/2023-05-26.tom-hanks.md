        text: 'Now listen, it’s not fair, but please don’t be embittered by this fact. Without having done a lick of work, without having spent any time in class, without once walking into that library  --  in order to have anything to do with the graduating class of Harvard, it’s faculty or it’s a distinguished alumni  --  I make a damn good living playing someone who did. It’s the way of the world, kids. On behalf of all of us who studied for two years at Chabot Community College in Hayward, California, two semesters at California State University, Sacramento, and for 45 years at the School of Hard knocks earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in one damn thing after another, thank you. I don’t know much about Latin, I have no real passion for enzymes and public global policy is something I scan in the newspaper just before I do the Wordle. And yet here I am closing. Closing for Josiah, Palace and Vic. Thank you.'

        text: 'Some of us here can recite by repetition the preamble to a television show we might have seen five days a week about a strange being from another planet, with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who disguised as a mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper … There were many metropolitan newspapers once, and some of them were great. Who could change the course of Mighty Rivers and Ben Steele with his bare hands, he was faster than a speeding bullet and he was more powerful than a locomotive and he was able to leap tall buildings at a single bound and those are very, very impressive superpowers, no? Well, what was most impressive about his powers was how he chose to wield them. Yeah, cats were saved from trees and evildoers were banished to the phantom zone and the innocent were rescued with reliable and assuring regularity.'

        text: 'But in those half hours, which have since grown many full length films and multiverses and God  --  you kids see them all  --  was the ongoing struggle for not just the protection and safety of the world, but to the exposing of crooks and their lies to the light of day. Superman, you see, and his proxies of Wonder Woman and Captain America and Black Panther and the Black Widow and The Fantastic Four. My God, there’s a million of them. They are all enmeshed in that never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way. And in such a struggle being a Superman is a plus. Even with his one lethal weakness, exposure to chunks of the wreckage of his home planet destroyed by its own hubris and apathy. But hey, there ain’t no Superman nor anyone else in his Justice League. There’s just us on this planet. Now, on occasions such as this, beware of certain orators who resort to using sage quotations from historical figures or the words of legends of literature and arts, the name-dropping of famous friends, as a claim to some wisdom or super ability.'

Or as a man named Marlon Brando once said to me, “Vic, would you pick up that name I just dropped?” “Marlon Brando, would you hold onto it till we’re done? Thank you. Give it back to me at the end. I’m going to need it back.” Yes, as a man named Marlon Brando once said to me on a message, he left on my telephone answering machine, “Tommy Handkerchief, this is Marlon Bran Flakes, calling you to ask where you are.”'

But when it came to his race, he wrote “Human." “But Tommy, what are we?” Oh, but human. Yeah, we are. We are oh, but human. Now, as an armchair historian who reads non-fiction for pleasure, the books divine that there has never been a graduating class that has not faced the greatest challenges of all time. That come every spring, the maelstrom of history swirl so wildly that no matter the year or the era or the generation, there is always an atmospheric river of events that makes right now the hinge upon which our fate is turning.'

Now, this is not because we have failed in our duties or are completely spent. We have done some very super things over our generations. It’s because we are all in a cage match, mixed martial arts battle royale with agents of hubris, apathy, intolerance, and braying incompetence, the malevolent equals to imperial Stormtroopers, Lex Luthor and Loki, and we could all use a superhero right now.'

We see beings who are young in restless with energy and imagination, with righteousness and enlightenment and joy and compassion. And we celebrate your proclaimed wisdom and your work ethic. We know no one is faster than a speeding bullet to our shame, every day to our shame. But we can still summon more power than a locomotive and we are able to leap tall buildings at a single bound if we have the right gizmo. We can change the course of mighty rivers if such a thing should be done, and we make machines that bend steel as easily as using our bare hands. And we know that to each other, we often seem like strange beings from another planet in habits and tastes and languages, with holidays and foods we eat and names of the days of the week all varying.'

Some of us can take care of a five-year-old kid and a toddler for 24 hours a day and never stop loving them. Some of us make sense of physics and economics and global policy. Some of us survive somehow on minimum earnings. Some of us graduate from colleges despite years of lockdowns and Zooms. Now these achievements are all stellar, even though yes, we are all but human.

Someone who will take on that work. Now a kooky uncle once said to me, “We should all stay in school as long as we can because the moment we graduate, we have to work every day for the rest of our lives.” Now that uncle was a bit bitter, but he was not wrong.'

It’s one that requires rigorous attention, unfading wherewithal and all hands. '

The American way is exampled in both plain sight and in subtle attitude. It’s in moments of routine exchange and in broad expectations. It’s in places of historic weight and import and in the small spaces in which we all stand. The American way could be exampled, would you respect the law and the rights of all, because if you don’t, who will? When your food is brought to you, will you thank the server? Because if you don’t, who will? Would you pick up the litter that has missed the recycling bin? Because if you don’t, who will?

The American way was first proposed not far from here, when subjects of the king demanded more control over their lives than that dictated by someone else’s definition of providence. At the same time, women had no legal re-courses. An entire segment of the population had been taken from their homeland and slaved to work as chattel regardless of their age. And the original inhabitants of this continent from sea to shining sea, the only ones who carried the DNA of America were considered subhuman.'

Well, I’m just asking. I’m just wondering.”'

Someone will report the world to you exactly as you wish it were full of alternative facts, of conjured narrative meant to buttress the status quo and deny its offenses or rejig the rules and muddy the playing field, depending on where one is on the food chain and the moral spectrum. The American way can be demonstrated without ceasing as a perpetual prayer by every big shot in any plain Jane or Joe Blow. Justice can be an everyday pursuit case by case, with both lightning speed and the slow inevitable effect of gravity. Truth though Lord, truth. Truth feeds up in the high country as elusive as serenity, yet as certain as the North Star and the Southern Cross. Truth is mined at the intersections of our chosen behaviors and our fixed habits in our personal boundaries.'

Indifference make citizens into indentured servants held in labor by the despots and tyrants whose default setting is cynicism, who outlawed dissent and banned art and dialogue and books. Who grab power any way they can enabled by the subterfuge of their co-conspirators, rewarding their rationale of the complicit, and surging into the vacuum caused by the indifference of a people who have been made weary by struggle, so weary that they lose hope and are left to yearn to be saved by the fiction of superheroes. Every day, every year, and for every graduating class, there is a choice to be made.'
