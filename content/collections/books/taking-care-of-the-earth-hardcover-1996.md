        text: 'Review from Booklist:  Noting that "we often hear discouraging news about the environment," Pringle gives children plenty of ideas for concrete things they can do to help protect the earth and its resources. He cites several examples of projects undertaken by schoolchildren around the country, such as the penny collection undertaken by Michigan students that yielded enough to buy eight acres of Costa Rican rain forest. Projects involve caring for local sites, composting, and recycling. Pringle is careful to show the complexities of some issues and advises children to do their research. Addresses of environmental organizations are included so that kids can follow through on the enthusiasm the suggestions will inspire.'
