        text: 'Dismal as it has been in other respects, the fall of 2017 has been good to readers of Homer. September brought us Daniel Mendelsohn’s “An Odyssey,” his memoir of teaching this poem about fathers and sons to a class at Bard College that included his own father. Now we have an excellent new translation of the epic by the British classicist Emily Wilson. Norton trumpets it as “the first English translation of the ‘Odyssey’ by a woman.” (Anne Dacier’s French prose version appeared in 1708.) But Wilson’s rendering is remarkable in other ways as well.'

But most have preferred iambic pentameter, the default meter for English poets. Chapman and Pope did the poems into rhyming couplets. Their successors favored blank verse. Recent translators have tried to split the difference between Greek and English; Stanley Lombardo, Robert Fagles and Stephen Mitchell all use a looser, longer but still five-beat line.'

        text: 'Wilson returns to strict iambic pentameter. Among modern renderings hers is perhaps closest to Robert Fitzgerald’s 1961 version. But there’s a further wrinkle. Homer’s hexameters run from 13 to 18 syllables. To fit them into his shorter 10-syllable line, Fitzgerald simply used more lines. But Wilson aims for a direct equation: one line of English for one of Greek. The result is an idiom of great spareness and simplicity:'

His “Odyssey” was archaic and fragmentary, an artifact forged by firelight and rusted by time. If Wilson’s version has an English model, it is rather the moving plainness of Matthew Arnold’s “Sohrab and Rustum”:'

So do the breezy complacency of Menelaus, the innocence of Nausicaa, the gruff decency of the swineherd Eumaeus. Wilson is good too with the poem’s undertones and double meanings. She made me hear for the first time the veiled menace when the disguised Odysseus answers an insult from one of the nastier suitors:'
