        text: '"Ehrlich captures both the otherworldly beauty and cruelty of the natural forces—the harsh wind, bitter cold, and swiftly changing seasons—in the remote reaches of the American West.

Together, these essays form an evocative and vibrant tribute to the life Ehrlich chose and the geography she loves.'
