These rules are illustrated with well-told political anecdotes and the book shares revealing insights about the nature of constituencies that leaders must capture in different political environments. It won''t surprise anyone that the power structure of FTSE boardrooms has much in common with African dictatorships, but it''s good to read the evidence.'

        text: 'There are two problems. First, the book is underpinned by the notion that politicians are self-interested rational actors whose choices are fixed and predictable. Economists used to think the same about consumers but behavioural science proved them wrong. Second, though students of politics, the authors assume the affectations of scientists and, in the cause of "impartiality", create a work of such galactic cynicism that it made me flinch on more than one occasion. "When addressing politics," they state, "we must accustom ourselves to think about the actions and interests of specific leaders rather than thinking and talking about fuzzy ideas like the national interest, the common good, and the general welfare."'
